There are several fairly complete specimens from Locality P3652 which are essentially similar
to the average leaves of this species, such as the original type specimens figured by Lesquereux.
In addition, there are several smaller leaves, one of which is here figured, which were identified
as Rhamnus marshallensis in my earlier report on the type Lance flora. After a thorough examina-
tion of the type collections at the U. S. National Museum, I believe that there can be no valid
basis for separating this species from R. cleburni. These smaller leaves differ from the type speci-
mens of R. cleburni only in the number of secondaries; they are precisely the same in their shape,
in their parallel, closely spaced secondaries, and in their very characteristic tertiary venation.
The Laramie specimen which Knowlton named R. marshallensis is here regarded as an incomplete
specimen of the same form.

The collections at the U. S. National Museum contain several undescribed specimens which
appear to belong to this species. In the Laramie collection, for example, there is a single specimen
(No. 4367, with Cissus lobato-crenata) which is similar; in the Vermejo collection there are 7
specimens (see especially Nos. 51216, 51219) which have the typical characters of R. cleburni;
and in the Denver collection there are 2 smaller leaves (No. 37828) which are similar in form and
size to the Lance Creek specimen here figured. It is evident that this species is well represented
in the late Cretaceous deposits of the Rocky Mountain region and is not yet authentically reported
from beds of undisputed Paleocene age.

After a continued search for comparable leaf forms among living species, Ι am convinced of
the close resemblance of these sossil leaves to the Dilleniaceae. The similarity to Doliocarpus
dentatus (Aubl.) Standley and Davilla multiflora St. Hil. has already been pointed out.¹ Con-
tinued reference to Rhamnus would only be misleading and is wholly unsupported by comparison
with modern leaves. It has therefore seemed advisable to refer this species to the genus Dillenites.
