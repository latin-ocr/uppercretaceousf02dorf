Viburnum whymperi Heer. Knowlton, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., vol. 11, 207, 1909.

There are 5 nearly complete specimens, from three localities, which Ι cannot distinguish
from the type and figured specimens of Vz'burnum montanum or VJ? problematicum. As was
pointed out in my discussion of these species in the report on the Medicine Bow flora, there is a
likelihood that the collection of a larger suite of leaves of this form would show that several other
species, such as V. contortum Lesquereux and V. speciosum Knowlton, are actually synonymous.

From an examination of the Lance Creek collections at the U. S. National Museum it is
clear that the specimens assigned by Knowlton to V. whymperz' Heer are in reality referable to
V. montanum.

The collections contain 5 well-preserved though incomplete specimens, of which the best is
figured, which agree in essential characteristics with the specimens referred by Lesquereux and
Brown to Anona robusta. Ι had provisionally called the Lance Creek specimens Ficus uncam.
Both the description and the original type specimens of the latter species show, however, that the
secondary veins are prominently branched on their lower sides. This is not the case in the Lance
Creek specimens nor in the Raton specimen which Knowlton referred to F. uncata.

As here conceived, this species is now known from the Laramie and Raton formations and
frorn the Lance of both Wyoming and Montana. Ι have not seen any species 111 1118 11118 “F ort
Union'’ or other beds of known Paleocene age with which this leaf form might be confused.

The modern relationships of this species are doubtfully known. The original reference to
Αηοηα 13 a reasonable one, though there are genera of both the Magnoliaceae and the Moraceae
which seem equally comparable.

Occurrence—Localities P3853, P3855.

Liriodendron sp., Brown, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 189, 251, pl. 52, fig. 7, 1939.

There are 10 specimens, from three localities, which are sufficiently complete and well
preserved to be identified with this species. On consulting the type specimens at the U. S. Na-
tional Museum, it appeared evident that the incomplete Colgate leaves which Brown referred to
Liriodendron sp. cannot be distinguished from the original types of Apeibopsz's? discolor from the
Black Buttes flora or from the Lance Creek specimens.

Ι suspect that the single specimen from Black Buttes which Lesquereux named Ficus
haydenii ¹ is in reality conspecific with those from the same locality referred to Apeibopsis? discolor.
In view of the fact that the type specimen of Ficus haydem'z' is at present not to be found, how-
ever, it seems advisable to await its discovery before making a final allocation.
