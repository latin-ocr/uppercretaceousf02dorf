LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 107

clear, are known only from deposits ranging from the top of the Colorado group be-
low to the top of the true Sphenodiscus-bearing F ox Hills above—ie, J udith River,
Belly River, Ericson-Almond (Mesaverde), and Fox Hills; species restricted to
Lancian age are those known only from bedslying between the top of the true Spheno-
discus-bearing Fox Hills and the top of the Triceratops-bearing beds—i.e.‚ Colgate,
Hell Creek, Medicine Bow, Laramie‚White1nud—lower Ravenscrag, Arapahoe—lower
Denver, and lower Dawson; those restricted to Paleocene age are those known only
from beds lying between the Triceratops-bearing beds below and the true Lower
Eocene Wasatchian above—ie, Tullock, Ludlow, F ort Union and equivalents,
middle and upper Ravenscrag, and Paskapoo.

Formations whose position in Montanan, Lancian, or Paleocene time is uncer-
tain because of lack of convincing stratigraphic or palaeontologic data are disre-
garded for the present. The correlation of most of these formations, including
the Fruitland, Kirtland, Vermejo, Whitemud, and “Laramie'' (Black Buttes) of
southwestern Wyoming, is made below on the basis of their floral assemblages.
