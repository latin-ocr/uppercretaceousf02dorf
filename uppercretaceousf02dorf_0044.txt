120 CONTRIBU'rroNS ‘ro PALAEONTOLOGY

Paleocene age. Pending the much-needed revision of Rocky Mountain Paleocene
floras, at present being undertaken by Dr. Roland W. Brown, of the U. S. Geological
Survey, it may be observed that of a total of over 250 Paleocene species there are
only 30, of which 15 are very doubtful, which are reported as extending from the
Paleocene into the Lance or from the Lance into the Paleocene. These are as

follows :

¹?Aralia notata Laurus primigenia
Araliaephyllum artocarpoides Magnolia magnifolia
‘?Araucarites longifolia ⁸?Magnolia pulchra
Celastrus? taurinensis Platanus aceroides
Cercidiphyllum arcticum Platanus raynoldsii integrifolia
Cercidiphyllum ellipticum ‘?Quercus? viburnifolia
Dillenites cleburni Salix angusta
Diospyros brachysepala ?Sapindus affinis
?Euonymus xantholithensis ¹?Sequ0ia dakotensis
‘lFicus coloradensis Sequoia nordenskioldi
?Ficus planicostata ‘?Taxodium occidentale
⁴?Fraxinus leii Thuja interrupta
Ginkgo adiantoides Trapa‘? microphylla
?Hicoria antiquora ‘fViburnum antiquum
¹?Laurophyllum coloradensis ‘?Viburnum whymperi

This list shows an extremely small number of species that are known definitely
to bridge the span between Lancian and Paleocene time. They represent only
about 6 per cent of the total number of species of either the Lancian or the Paleocene
assemblage. It is difficult to explain this great difference between the typically
Lancian forests and those of the Paleocene of the same general region, particularly in
view of the apparent conformity between the Lancian and Paleocene rocks. Ι 3111
1101 prepared to offer an explanation, though I believe it may be sought in one or
another, or some combination‚ of the following suggestions: (1) there may exist an
unrecognized hiatus between the Lancian and Paleocene deposits; (2) there have as
yet not been a sufficient number of specimens collected from the upper parts of the
Lancian formatioris or the lower parts of the Paleocene to present a true picture of
the floral changes; (3) the late Lancian orogeny in the Rocky Mountain region may
have been of sufficient intensity to cause rather sudden and widespread environ-
mental changes and concurrent floral changes; (4) the sudden 110131 change in the
early Paleocene may have been a result of a rather rapid invasion of the Rocky
Mountain region, possibly from eastern North Amcrica by way of the newly opened
route around the north end of the early Paleocene Cannonball sea.

Other floras—There are other floras in the Rocky Mountain region and else-
where which have a few species in common with that of the type Lance formation,
as is shown in table 3. These floras are, however, too remotely related to that of
the type Lance or other formations of Lancian age to be considered further at the
present time.

I ndeae species and dominants os Lancian floras—From the foregoing analyses
it is evident that there are a number of species in the flora of the type Lance which
are, so far as is known, restricted elsewhere to floras of Lancian age. These are
shown, along with those of wider stratigraphic range, in table 4. Theoretically,
