Dombeyopsis colgatensis Brown

There are 5 well-preserved specimens, 2 of which are figured, which agree in all essential
details of shape, venation, and marginal characters with the type specimens of this species from
the Colgate flora. The slightly larger size of the Lance Creek specimens is not considered of
taxonomic importance.

Except for the attenuate and acuminate character of their bases and tips, the leaves of
Dombeyopsis colqalensis are comparable to those of D. obtusa.¹ In all the latter, however, the
bases are obtuse or only slightly attenuate and the leaf tips are invariably bluntly obtuse or
slightly emarginate. The venation of these two species is remarkably similar. No other close
resemblances to described species have been observed.

As was pointed out by Brown, the reference of this leaf form to Dombeyopsz‘s, implying rela-

tionship to the living Dombeya, is not wholly satisfactory. Ι have not been able to find any modern
leaves with comparable characters.

Occurrence—Locality P3854.

The collections contain 4 nearly complete specimens which are referable to this species. Ι
suspect that if a large suite of specimens of this species and of Dombeyopsis colqatensz's were ever
obtained, there might appear to be gradational variations between these two species. The
consistent features of D. obtusa seem to be the obtuse character of both the bases and the tips of its
leaves.

The occurrence of this species in the true Lance formation further enhances its value as an
important index species of the Upper Cretaceous sediments of the Rocky Mountain region. It is
known elsewhere from the Laramie, Trinidad, Vermej0, lower Denver, Dawson, and Medicine
Bow formatioris, and has not been found in beds of known Paleocene or later age.

The uncertain systematic status of this species has been discussed in my previous report,
cited above.

Occurrence—Localities P3854, P3859.
