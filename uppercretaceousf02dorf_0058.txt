There are nearly a hundred specimens, from six localities, which agree closely with the speci—
mens which Berry described and figured from the lower Lance (Hell Creek) formation of Harding
County, South Dakota. The Lance Creek specimens apparently differ only in the somewhat
more widely spaced marginal teeth. Since the marginal characters of the Harding County speci-
mens are poorly preserved, it may be that more adequate specimens would reveal the same kind
of teeth as are seen in those from the Lance Creek area.

There are apparently no other later Cretaceous or early Tertiary species of Saliae with which
these specimens can be compared. There is a possibility that they may be slender forms of
F rustinus leii Berry, from which they appear to differ mainly in their very lanceolate shape and
their more numerous secondaries and marginal teeth.

The generic reference to Saliae seems reasonably justifiable.

There are 3 specimens which are sufficiently complete to indicate their identity with the
type and figured specimens of Salix wyomz'nqensis from the Black Buttes and Laramie floras. I
have also seen the specimen from the Lance formation which Knowlton referred to Quercus
cinereoides and find it indistinguishable. The original type specimen of Q. cinereoides (“Locality
unknown'') is not to be found in the collection at the U. S. National Museum, hence Ι have
questioned its reference to the new combination. I can see no justifiable basis of distinction
for the Laramie specimen described by Knowlton as Laurus lakesz'i, which was collected from the
same locality as several specimens of Salia: wyominqensz's.

This somewhat generalized leaf form may be distinguished from other species of similar
shape by the number and the high angle of its secondaries, which loop abruptly upward near the
margins, by its indistinct tertiary venation, and by its entire margins. It resembles, except for
its tertiary venation, the specimcns from Evanston, Wyoming, which Lesquereux referred to
Laurus primiyenia Unger.¹

A definite reference of this species to the existing genus Salia: seems unwarranted. Its
characters seem equally lauraceous.'·’ Pending more definite comparisons, it is advisable to refer
it to the form genus Salio-immuunt, indicating only a similarity to the leaves of Saliz.
