LANCE FLonA OF EASTERN wroMING 157

There are 2 nearly complete specimens of winged fruits which differ in many details from the
specimen referred below to Carpites ulmisormis, which they resemble in a general way.

Description-Impressions show a perfectly oval samara 13 mm. long and 10—12 mm. wide,
apparently completely surrounded by a narrow wing 2-3 mm. wide; seed impression large, 11 mm.
long by 7—9 mm. wide, centrally marked by a longitudinal furrow and 2 flanking longitudinal lines ;
wing marked by numerous straight, spinelike veins; margin entire.

Except for the longitudinal furrow and lines, there is nothing in common between these
winged fruits and that of C. ulmisormis. No comparable fruits have been described or reported,
though there is a general similarity to Carpolz'thus hirsutus Newberry,¹ which was previously
regarded as the same. In this species from the Raritan formation the fruits are smaller, are
marked by only a single wide groove down the middle, and are distinctly surrounded by bristles
rather than a membraneus wing. In undescribed collectione at the U. S. National Museum there
are several winged fruits which are identical with those of Carpitcs lancensz's; these were collected
by Brown from the Hell Creek formation of Montana and from the true Lance “on Lance Creek,
east bank, opposite and above the month of Bull Creek.'’ 2

The modern relationships or resemblances of these fossil fruits are unknown at the present
time.

Carpites ulmiformis Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 17, Figs. 17, 18)
Ulmus spe, Knowlton, Bull. Geol. Soc. Amen, vol. 8, 1930, 1897; Proc. Washington Acad. Sci„ vol. 11, 207, 1909

This species is based on the single specimen figured, which was collected by Knowlton from
near the old “Buck Creek corrals.'’ This locality is in the same vicinity as Locality P3859 of
the present report.

Description-—This impression consists of an obovate samara 16 mm. long and 13 mm. wide
just above the middle; apex openly notched; base acutely elongated into a thin pedicel of indeter-
minable length; seed impression narrowly ovoid, 6 mm. wide, extending nearly the full length of
the samara, marked distinctly by a central furrow, and less distinctly by 2 longitudinal lines on
opposite sides of the furrow ; wing broad, entire-margined, and reticulate-veined.

Ι have not seen any described or figured fossil fruit which has the characters of this species.
In attempting to allocate this fruit to an existing genus I was at first inclined to follow Knowlton
in his original reference to Ulmus. After consulting all available species of this genus at the New
York Botanical Garden, however, Ι became convinced that the Lance Creek specimen differs
consistently in two respects: (l) it lacks the persistent remnants of the calyx at the base; (2) the
prominent furrow and longitudinal lines on the fossil impression have no counterparts, either as
lines, furrows, or ridges, in the seeds of the modern species of Ulmus. Despite a further con-
centrated search among living species with winged fruits, 1 have not been successful in finding a
modern analogue.

There is a single, nearly perfect impression which agrees in essential details with the specimens
and description of this species from the Black Buttes flora. Its original description was as follows:
