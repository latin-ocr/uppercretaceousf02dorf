128 CONTRIBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

Although widely recorded in floras of Cretaceous and Tertiary age, the remains of Equisetum
are too generalized to be safely used for purposes of correlation.

Occurrence—Localities P3853, Ρ3856, Ρ3858, Ρ3859.

There are 5 specimens from Locality P3853 which were at first regarded as Selaqinella
laciniam. After consulting the collections at the U. S. National Museum, however, I believe
that the two species listed above, which were collected from precisely the same locality, represent
one and the same species in different states of preservation. The distinguishing features of these
two species have been the threadlike laciniae of S. laciniam and the narrow leaves of S.? falcata.
Both of these features are to be seen on a single stalk in several of the Lance Creek specimens.
There are apparently no other comparable specimens reported from Cretaceous or Tertiary floras
of North America.

The reference of this species to Selayinella is doubtful, as is indicated by the question mark
originally inserted by Lesquereux. I have been unable to find any living species with either
aerial or submerged leaves of this particular form.

Occurrence——Locality P3853.

There is a single specimen from Locality P3857 which clearly is a characteristic fan-shaped
leaf of the modern genus Ginkqo. The widespread occurrences of Tertiary representatives of this
genus are usually referred to the nominal species Ginkqo adiantoides, whose leaves are identical
with those os the living species G. biloba Linne. Several attempta have been made by palaeo-
botanists to distinguish the late Crctwaceous Ginkqo leaves as a separate species, G. laramiensis.
As Berry has pointed out,¹ the leaf forms shown in specimens os both the Cretaceous and the
Tertiary species fail “to disclose as much variation as can be selected from a single existing tree.’'
