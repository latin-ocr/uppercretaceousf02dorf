LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 117

cene. This analysis is, of course, very suggestive of Lancian age, but cannot be
considered conclusive because of the small number of species in the assemblage.
Fortunately, the suggestive floral testimony is made rather conclusive by the
occurrence of the typical Lancian dinosaur Triceratops in the lower Ravenscrag
deposits.

The floras of the middle and upper Ravenscrag beds, also described by Berry,
are so clearly Paleocene that they do not need further analysis herc.

Fruitland—Kz'rtland floras—The flora of the Fruitland formation of northwestern
New Mexico has been described by Knowlton.1 From his analysis of the floral
assemblage he concluded that the beds were of Montanan age. This conclusion is
supported by the following analysis:

No outside distribution ....... 17
Outside distribution .......... 14 (3 in common with type Lance)
Total number of species ..... ᾖ
Short-ranging species: Long-ranging species: Species of uncertain range . Ο
Montanan ..... 4 (÷2?) Pre-Montanam-Montanum ........ 1
Lancian. . . . . . . Ο Montanan-Lancian .............. 6
Paleocene ..... 0 Pre-Montanan-Montanan-Lancian 1
6 (5²) 8

From the fact that 3 of the short-ranging species are known elsewhere only in
the lower Vermejo and that the 2 species questioned in the list are also restricted
to the Vermejo, but of unknown stratigraphic position, it can be concluded that the
Fruitland is not younger than Vermejo, and most likely synchronous with the
lower Vermejo.

The Kirtland flora, described by Knowlton as an integral unit of the Fruitland
flora, comprises at present only 7 species. Such a small assemblage is, in my opin-
ion, not a fair sample for reliable correlation, particularly in view of the fact that
only 3 of the species have an outside distribution. Until a larger floral assemblage is
known, it can only be said that from its relation to overlying and underlying beds
the Kirtland shale is either late Montanan or early Lancian in age.

Ericson-Almond flora—Fossil plants collected near Point of Rocks in south-
western Wyoming have been described by Ward,2 Lesquereux,³ and Knowlton.4
These specimens were collected at a time when neither stratigraphic nor geographie
position could be easily determined. From the published reports and my visit to
the area, however, it seems reasonably certain that most of the plants were obtained
from the massive sandstone and overlying shale exposed ὲ to ὲ mile north and east
of the Point of Rocks station on the Union Pacific railroad. The massive sandstone
has since been called the Ericson sandstone and the overlying shales the Almond
formation.5 These were included in the Mesaverde group on the basis of their
stratigraphic position below the Lewis shale, whose marine fauna is of late Montanan
