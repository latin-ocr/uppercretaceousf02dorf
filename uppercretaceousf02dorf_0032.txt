This analysis of the Lance flora is not introduced in order to ascertain its age,
since it is obviously of Lancian age as defined. The data will be useful, however, in
comparing the analyses of other floras with that of the Lance.

The question may be raised as to the significance of the small Paleocene and
Montanan elements in the Lance flora. In view of the overwhelming majority of
species restricted elsewhere to floras of known Lancian age, it is evident that the
4 species previously thought to be restricted in stratigraphic range can no longer be
so considered, unless, of course, other investigators should disagree with my identi-
fications of these species. Moreover, it is to be expected that future work with
floras of Paleocene and Montanan age will extend the stratigraphic range of species
now known only in floras of Lancian age.

As will be amplified below in the discussion of the Paleocene “Fort Union''
flora, the analysis above shows that the flora of the type Lance formation is dis-
tinctly not a “ Fort Union '' assemblage, but is closely related to floras obtained from
beds lying between the true F ox Hills formation and the top of the Triceratops zone.
These comprise the Colgate—Hell Creek, Laramie, and Medicine Bow floras, whose
analyses follow. These are presented in order to determine the reliability of floral
assemblages in the correlation of deposits whose contemporaneity is already rather
definitely established on the basis of similar stratigraphic position, similar relations
to underlying marine invertebrates, and similar associations with dinosaur remains.

Colyate—Hell Greek floras—The Colgate flora of eastern Montana and western
South Dakota1 is here combined with the Hell Creek flora of the same region for
three reasons: (1) Since the Colgate beds lie above the Sphenodiscits-bearing Fox
Hills marine sandstone, they obviously are of Lancian age as defined. (2) The
Colgate beds are laterally discontinuous and are seen to interfinger along the strike
with the lower beds of the Lance formation as originally defined at its type locality.
(3) The flora of the Colgate beds is distinctly a Lancian flora, containing 13 species,
out of 17 species with outside distribution, in common with the type Lance flora3
of these 17, 8 are long-ranging species, 6 aro restricted elsewhere to Lancian age, and
3 are at present of uncertain range but probably Lancian. In this connection it
seems significant to mention that the Colgate beds were originally defined as the
lower member of the Lance fo1·1nation.² Their redefinition as a member of the F ox
Hills sandstone ³ does not seem supported by conclusive facts. particularly in view
of the criteria now used elsewhere for the recognition of the upper limit of the F ox
Hills sandstone.⁴ It is felt, however, that whatever the allocation of the Colgate
beds as a lithologic unit, there should be no confusion as to their temporal position.

The Colgate and Hell Creek floras have been described by Brown,⁵ and a small
Hell Creek flora from South Dakota has been described by Berry.⁰ In the Sayen
collection of Colgate plants at Princeton University there are, besides most of
Brown's recorded species, also specimens of Getasa-us? taurinensis Ward and
