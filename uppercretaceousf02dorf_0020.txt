interbedded shales are also yellowish, and are soft and sandy, and non-concretion-
ary. The coal beds are generally thin but are of better quality than the lignites of
the Lance formation. The thickness of the “Tullock” formation in this region is
roughly estimated at about 400 feet.

The beds above the “Tullock'' were not examined in the Lance Creek area.
In the Gillette coal field Dobbin and Barnett divided these beds into the Lebo shale
member and the Tongue River member of the Fort Union “formation'’ ¹

The various units of the Fort Union group of the Lance Creek area and con-
tiguous areas have yielded a considerable number of fossil plants. The following
identified speeies were reported by Knowlton from the lower 200 feet of the Fort
Union “formation ⁷' of the region shown in figure 2: ²

Ampelopsis montanensis Cockerell Grewia celastroides W ard
(Vitis cuspidata of Knowlton) Grewia erenata (Unger) Heer
Celastrus pterospermoides Ward Parottia cuneata (Newberry) Berry
Celastrus? taurinensis Ward (Viburnum cuneatum of Knowlton)
(C. curvinervis of Knowlton) Platanus raynoldsii Newberry
Cornus newberryi Hollick‘? Sequoia nordenskioldi Heer
(C. acuminata? of Knowlton) Zizyphus serrulatus Ward

Diospyros brachysepala Al. Braun

Only 1 of these species, Celastrus? taurinensis, is known also from the underlying
type Lance formation. Sequoia nordenslcio'ldi is known elsewhere from beds of
Lance age, but is of no correlative significance‚ as it represents a type of eonifer
foliage of extended stratigraphie range from the Upper Cretaceous into the Ceno-
zoic. Of the remaining 9 speeies, 5 are known elsewhere only in the type Fort
Union or other undoubted Paleocene beds, and the remaining 4 species are known
only in beds of Paleocene and Eoeene age. This analysis leaves little doubt as to
the Paleocene age of the beds.

During the summer of 1938 Ι collected, on the basis of information received
from Dr. William W. Rubey, of the U. S. Geological Survey‚³ a number of fossil
plants from the lower 100 feet of the Tullock formation of the Gillette coal field area.
These were obtained from an old coal prospect on Coal Draw, 11 miles south by east
of Mooreroft, Wyoming, SE. r} sec. 28, T. 48 N., R. 67 W. The following species
have been identified:

Aneimia lanceolata Knowlton Platanus coloradensis Knowlton
Celastrus? taurinensis Ward Sapindus affinis Newberry
Glyptostrobus dakotensis Brown Sequoia nordenskioldi Heer

Hieoria antiquora (Newberry) Knowlton 'l'huja interrupta Newberry
Onoelea sensibilis fossilis Newberry

In this assemblage‚ the 2 species which oeeur also in the type Lance or equiva-
lent beds (Celastrus? taurinensis and Sequoia nordenskio'ldi) are elsewhere known to
extend from late Cretaceous into Paleocene time and were discussed above. Of the
remaining 7 species, 5 are known definitely only in undoubted Paleocene beds, and
