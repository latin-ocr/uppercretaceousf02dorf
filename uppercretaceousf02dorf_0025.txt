and the essentially subtropical Medicine Bow. In texture and venation characters
they are only 4 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, out of accord with the Medicine
Bow flora. In their combined characters the Lance species are closest to those of
the Medicine Bow flora, which is considered intermediate between warm temperate
and subtropical, more nearly approaehing the latter. In view of the usual difficul-
ties of definition it may be said that the leaf characters of the Lance species indicate
climatic conditions intermediate between warm temperate and subtropical, more
nearly approaching the former.

As the data of table 1 were being arranged, it became apparent that the per-
centages representing the Lance, Medicine Bow, and Laramie leaf characters fall
rather precisely into a steady progression. In terms of climatic conditions this is
interpreted to mean that the Lance conditions were somewhat more temperate than
those of the Medicine Bow, which in turn were somewhat more temperate (or less
subtropical) than those of the Laramie. Since these three floras are essentially con-
temporaneous and occupy progressively more southerly positions in latitude, such
an observation is rather to be expected in view of latitudinal control of vegetational
zones. It was consequently a natural step to determine whether or not the con-
temporaneous Colgate—Hell Creek flora, from a region lying north of the Lance
deposits, would fit into this progression. This it does to a large degree, as is shown
in table 1. In length, texture, and marginal characters the Colgate—Hell Creek
species indicate, as anticipated, a slightly more temperate aspect than the Lance
species. A considerable discrepancy is to be noted, however, in venation charac-
ters, which are the same in the Colgate—Hell Creek species as in the more sub-
tropical Laramie species. I can offer no suggestion as to the real meaning of this
discrepancy. It must be noted, however, that there is another inexplicable anomaly
in this column of table 1, namely, the abnormally high percentage of pinnately
veined leaves in the temperate Muir Woods and Bridge Creek floras.
