Fox Hills sandstone:

Sandstones, yellowish brown, soft, interbedded with sandy, light—colored shale
{probably in part Lance]

The lower limit of the Lance formation has been discussed under the Fox Hills
sandstone. The upper limit, following its original definition, has been conveniently
drawn at the top of the dinosaur-bearing beds. This horizon coineides with a
marked change, without a recognized erosional or structural unconformity, from the
characteristic dull-gray shales and shaly sandstones of the typieal Lance formation
to a sequence of more persistent ridge-forming yellowish sandstones, yellowish
sandy shales, and coal beds.

The Lance formation of the Lance Creek area has yielded abundant fossil
remains of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. The dinosaur remains, most of
which were collected from the area included in figure 2, have been discussed recently
by Russell¹ and ΙΛιΠ.2 The mammalian fauna has been thoroughly treated by
Simpson‚³ and the invertebrates have been listed by both Stanton ‘¹ and Henderson.⁵
Up to the present report the plant remains have not been systematically treated, and
only a provisional list of species has been published by Knowlt011.⁰

Except for the few specimens kindly loaned to me by the U. S. National Mu-
seum, the plant remains described in the present report were collected by me from
the Lance formation at the following localities, shown in figure 2:

Locality P3853. Base of low ridge, near center of SE. ὲ sec. 23, T. 36 N., R. 65 W. (See
plate l, figs. 1, 2.) Leaves occur in great numbers in a dull-gray, hard, calcareous sandstone,
which is a lenticular unit within a thir-ker unit of gray, narbonae-eous, sandy shales and thin lignite
beds. The horizon is about 210 fect above the top of the Fox Hills sandstone. The following
species of plants were obtained here:

Anona? robusta Asplenites tenellum
Araucarites longifolia Canna? magnifolia
