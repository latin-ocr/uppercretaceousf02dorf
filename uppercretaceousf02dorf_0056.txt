Sobel? eocenica Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Bull. 696, 557, 1919.

There are 2 impressions from Locality P3853 which have the characters considered diagnostic
of this species. Knowlton has previously reported this species (as F tabellaria encenica) from the
Lance Creek area.¹ I have seen this specimen in the collections at the U. S. National Museum;
it is not numbcred, so that the exact locality from which it was collected is not known. In view
of the present discovery of this species in the same region, it is reasonably certain that Knowlton
was correct in stating that his specimen was collected from the type Lance formation.

In addition to its present occurrence, this species is reported only from floras which I con-
sider the uppermost Cretaceous in the Rocky Mountain region: the Black Buttes, the lower Raton,
and the Medicine Bow; it is also present in the Laramie flora, being represented in the collection os
undescribed and unlabeled Laramie specimens at the U. S. National Museum (specimens Nos.
570a, 1327).

Occurrence—Locality P3853.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Pleisotype No. 2487.

?Sabal riaida Hatcher, Ann. Carnegie Mus, vol. 1, 263, text fig. 1, 1901.

In addition to a large number of impressions of the outer rays of palm leaves, the Lance Creek
collections contain 2 impressions of the basal parts os leaves, of which the better is figured. In
size, approximate number of rays, and length and character of acumen, these impressions are
referable to the species Sabalites montana.

In 1900 Hatcher collected an impression of a part of a palm leaf from the Lance Creek area.
This was described and figured as a new species, Sabal riqida. In the absence of the diagnostic
basal part of this leaf, it is doubtful whether the recognition of this specimen as a distinct species
will serve any usesul purpose. I have questionably united it with the present species, whose
outer rays are of the same general character and size.

As known at present, this species occurs in the upper Mesaverde group and the Vermejo,
Laramic,² Medicine Bow, lower Denver, and type Lance formations.

Occurrence—Locality P3853.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Plesiotype No. 2486.
