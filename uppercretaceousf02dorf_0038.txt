The time relations between the Black Buttes ‘¹ Laramie ’² and other deposits of
Laneian age are shown in figure 3. The transition between the so-called “Fox
Hills'' and the overlying “ Laramie ” is tentatively placed somewhat earlier than in
eastern Colorado because of the absence of diagnostic invertebrates of the Spheno-
discus zone in the “ F ox Hills '' of this region. It is suggested that in the future the
Black Buttes ‘⁴ Laramie” be referred either to the Lance formation or to the Medi-
01110 Bow formation, to either of which it is both nearer geographically and more
nearly synchronous in its entirety than it is to the true Laramie of the Denver basin.

Vermejo-Raton floras—In south-central Colorado the terrestrial beds overlying
1110 late Montanan marine deposits have been separated rather arbitrarily into two
formatioris, the Vermejo and the overlying Raton. No vertebrates are known from
either of these formatioris, so their age determinations must be based primarily on
the fossil plants and on the evidence from the underlying marine rocks. The latter
are the Trinidad sandstone, whose fauna appears to be late Montanan, probably
somewhat older than true Fox Hills.l The Vermejo flora, adequately described by
Knowlton⁷ was referred by him to Montanan age.2 The present study agrees in
part with such an age assignment, as is shown in the following analysis of the
V ermejo species:

No outside distribution ..... 45

This is a more difficult analysis to evaluate than any of the others presented.
In the first place there are, out of 43 5ρο0105 with outside distribution, 17 species
(40 per cent) in common with the flora of the type Lance formation. This is 15 10
36 per cent less than in any of the floras known to be of true Lancian age. Yet
there 310 11 0111 of 19 short-ranging species which are restricted elsewhere to Lancian
age, and 3 long-ranging species which are not known earlier than Lancian time.
These are as follows:

Laneian age only:
Aneimia supercretaeea Ficus tessellata

Artoearpus dissecta Magnolia nervosa
Asplenium? eoloradensis Palaeoaster inquirenda
Canna? magnifolia Quereophyllum gardneri
Cissites panduratus Viburnum marginatum

Credneria protophylloides

Not known previous to lianc-ian age:

Dillenites eleburni Quercus? viburnisolia
Sahal? ungeri
