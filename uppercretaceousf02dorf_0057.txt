LANCE FLORA or EAs'rERN WYOMING 133

There are 27 specimens clearly referable to this well-defined species, from two localities in
the Lance Creek area. Most of the specimens are well preserved, although the venation seems
always to be only faintly impressed, as a result of the thick texture of the leaves.

Pistia corrugata was described by Lesquereux from abundant remains in the upper Mesaverde
group at Point of Rocks, Wyoming. The original description is as follows:

“Leaves broadly obovate, incrassated from the middle toward the base, bordered upward
by a wavy margin, gradually narrowed into a short pedicel with bundles of radicles at its base ;
veins going out from the pedicel in two or three compact faseicles, dividing in passing up from the
base of the leaves, and forming, by cross-branchlets, large irregular polygonal meshes,''

The abundant specimens in the Lance Creek collections do not differ in any respect from the
above description. Comparisons with ‘the type specimens at the U. S. National Museum have
shown that the average size of the Lance Creek leaves is somewhat greater than that of the type
specimens figured by Lesquereux. Berry has made the same observation on specimens from the
Whitemud formation of Saskatchewan. There are, however, several unfigured specimens from
the Mesaverde formation in the collections at the U. S. National Museum which closely approach
in size the Lance and Whitemud specimens. On the basis of other variations observed in a large
number of specimens from the Fox Hills and Colgate, Brown has synonymized the specimen of
Ottelz'a americana Lesquereux and one specimen of Lemna scutata Dawson with Pistia corrugata.

As known at present, the leaves of P. corruqata, which are usually well defined and fairly
common, are valuable index forms for the Montana and post-Montana Cretaceous. They are
now known from the Mesaverde, Judith River, Kirtland, Belly River, Whitemud, Fox Hills,
Colgate, and true Lance formations. No comparable leaves have ever been reported from the
extensive “Fort Union’' flora of the Rocky Mountain region. The Wilcox species, Pistia wil—
coxensis, is regarded by Berry as “clearly distinct from previously described fossil forms of Piscz‘a.” ¹

The reference of these fossil leaves to the genus Pistia has been amply substantiated by
comparison with leaves of the single living species. They are, indeed, difficult to separate from
the leaves of the modern “water lettuce,'⁷ Pistz'a stratiotes Linne,² which is widespread in south-
eastern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America, and is known also in Asia and
Africa.

The specimen here figured is the better of 2 incomplete leaves of this type in the Lance
Creek collectione. Except sor the somewhat larger angle of divergence of the secondary venation,
these leaves cannot be distinguished from the figured and type specimen of Canna? maqnisolz’a
from the Vermejo formation of Colorado. The Medicine Bow specimen referred to Canna cf.
Cf? maqnisolia differs only in the absence of the alternation of thick and thin veins.³ I have not
been able to compare these specimens with the reported example of this species which Berry de-
scribed from the lower Lance (Hell Creek) formation of South Dakota.⁴

The uncertainty regarding the taxonomic affinities of this species has been discussed in my
cited report on the Medicine Bow flora.
