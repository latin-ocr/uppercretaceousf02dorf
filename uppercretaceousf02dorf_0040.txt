116 CONTRIBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

the total of 18 species, 13 are known only from the lower 500 feet of the Raton, 2
(A rlocarpus similis and Ficus planicostata) are known from both the lower and the
upper Raton, and only 2 (Cornophyllum wardii and Platanus rhomboidea) are
known only from the middle or upper Raton. These facts seem to me to indicate
that a part of the lower Raton formation is of Lancian age, specifically upper Lan-
eian age, corresponding to the Triceracops-bearing beds of the Arapahoe—lower Den-
ver and the lower Dawson.

W hitemud—lower Ravenscray floras—The Whitemud formation of southern
Saskatchewan has yielded a flora of 26 species, described by Berry.¹ Omitting 4
species which Berry says are only questionably determined, the analysis of this
flora is as follows:

No outside distribution ....... 4
Outside distribution .......... 18 (8 in common with type Lance)
Total number of speeies ..... ΞΞ
Short-ranging species: Long-ranging species: Species of uncertain range . 4
Montanan ......... Ο Montanan-Lancian-Paleocene.. 3
Lancian. . . . . . ⁴ . . 5 Montanan-Lancian ........... 4
Paleocene .......... 1 Lancian-Paleoeene ........... 1
6 8

Out of a total of 18 speeies with outside distribution, 8 (44 per cent) are also
found in the type Lance flora. This percentage is somewhat lower than that seen
in typical Lancian floras, and is of the same order as in the Vermejo flora, of late
Montanan and early Lancian age. Yet in the appraisal of the short—ranging species
it is noted that no Whitemud species are restricted elsewhere to Montanan age, 6
are restricted to Lancian age, and 1 is restricted to the Paleocene. These are as
follows:

Restricted elsewhere to Lancian age:

Leguminosites arachioides minor Viburnum marginatum
Nelumbo tenuifolia Zizyphus coloradensis
Smilax? inquirenda

Restricted elsewhere to Paleocene age:
Viburnum antiquum

The overwhelming preponderance of restricted Lancian species in the white-
mud should cast suspicion on the identification of the single restricted Paleocene
species, which is not figured in Berry’s report. The conclusion from the analysis is
definitely that the Whitemud flora is of Lancian age. From occurrences of its
species elsewhere its assemblagc seems also to be carly rather than late Lancian.

The flora of the lower Ravcnscrag formation of southern Saskatchewan com-
prises only 9 specics, of which 2 are of doubtful validity.² Of 6 species with outside
distribution, 2 (F icus? ceratops and Fraxinus lcii) are restricted to Lancian age, 2
(Ginkqo adiantoides and Dillenites cleburni) are more abundant in Lancian floras
than in the Paleocene, and 1 (Aralia notata) is known elsewhere only in the Paleo-
