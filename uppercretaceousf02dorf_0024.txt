100 CONTRIBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

As regards frequency of occurrence, the following 13 species are recorded from
four or more of the type Lance localities:

Dryophyllum subfalcatum ......... 6 Viburnum marginatum ............ 5
Quercus? viburnifolia. . . . . . . . Δ . Α . . . G Dombeyopsis trivialis ............. 4
Salix laneensis. ................... 6 Equisetum sp ..................... 4
Typha sp ........................ 6 Platanophyllum montanum ........ 4
Fraxinus leii ................ γ . . , . 5 Vitis stantoni .................... 4
Sequoia dakotensis ............... 5 Grewiopsis saportana .............. 4
Trapa? microphylla ............... 5

Α comparison of this list with that of the 10 species which are of greatest indi-
vidual abundance shows that 7 of the latter are also among the 13 most persistent
species of the Lance flora, as at present known. The remaining 3 species are very
abundant locally but are each restricted to two of the nine Lance Creek localities.

CLIMATIC CONDITIONS INDICATED BY THE LANCE FLORA

There are in my opinion two reliable methods of employing fossil plants as
indicators of climatic conditions of the past ; both methods apply only to floras of
late Mesozoic or Cenozoic time, and each method is wholly independent of the
other. These are (1) an analysis of the structural characters of the dicotyledonous
leaves (chiefly size, venation, texture, and marginal characters) as compared with
modern leaves of known climatic requirements; and (2) a generic and specific com-
parison of fossil species with living forms whose climatic requirements are known,
on the assumption that the past conditions were analogous to those under which
the majority of the closely related living species grow.

The application of these methods to early and middle Tertiary floras has been
described by Chaney and Sanborn,¹ MacGinitie,2 and Potbury.³ The details of
their application to Upper Cretaceous floras are contained in my report on the
Medicine Bow flora.⁴ Although neither of these methods is strictly quantitative,
they are considered much more accurate than conclusions based on individual
species or genera, particularly since each method may be used as a check against
the other.

Thc analyses of thc leaf characters of the dicotyledonous Lance species are
shown in table 1. For purposes of comparison the table also includes analyses of
various modern and fossil assemblages studied by the authors mentioned above or
by me. In each category in the table the Lance flora stands between the warm
temperate to subtropical floras and the subtrepical to tropical. The percentage of
entire-leaved species in the Lance flora (54 per cent) is similar to the highest figure
obtained by Bailey and Sinnott for warm temperate sorestsf’ This is in agreement
with the intermediate position of this flora, in respect to this character, between the
warm temperate Weavervillc flora and the subtropical Goshen flora. In their com-
parative lengths the Lance species are between the warm temperate La Porte flora
