covery of a fair sample, it would indeed be rare to find absolute 100 per cent identity
between two or more sets of fossil assemblages. Moreover, slight differences in
environmental conditions, which may follow each other in short spaces of time or in
short distances, may be expected to have produced slight or even marked differences
in various assemblages of organisms. Finally, it must be recognized that similar
assemblages may be homotaxial rather than synchronous. For most problems of
correlation, however, this qualification is not necessary, since the span of time
needed for the migration of newly evolved organisms from one region to another is
negligible as compared with the time required for the deposition of the average
geological formation. If barriers to migration are known to have existed, however,
homotaxis must be considered.

2. The most useful index fossils are those which are abundant, easily identified,
and of wide geographie range and short stratigraphic range. Although generally
understood and usually reliable in application, this principle needs some qualifica-
tion. Each investigator, for example, is entitled to an opinion as to the exact mean-
ing of such terms as “abundant,” “easily‚'' “wide,'' and “short.” Moreover, fos-
sils that seem reliable today may become unreliable tomorrow as a result of new
discoveries extending their stratigraphic range. Furthermore, a short stratigraphic
range of a species or genus cannot be established unless its position in time can be
determined at several stations by clear stratigraphic relations and by associations
with other organisms. It is also considered more satisfactory for correlation to use
index associations of as many species as possible, rather than merely a single or a
few index species. F inally, in cases where index fossils present conflicting evidence,
careful consideration must be given to such possibilities as mixed collections, in-
eorrect identifications, and inadequate delimitation of zones.

3. The earliest appearance of new forms in abundanee is a valuable criterion for
correlation.

4. The latest appearance of old forins is sometimes an important guide, par-
ticularly when they are aceompanied by other organisms os restricted range. The
earliest appearance of new forms is, Ι believe, a safer criterion than the latest ap-
pearance of old forms, since the latter may be surviving relicts of long-ranging
organisms‚ whereas the ineoming of abundant new forms to a region is generally a
result of invasion or major environmental change, either of which would result
in widespread biotic changes which would be useful in exact correlation within that
region.

5. The dominance of certain genera or species is a reliable adjunct to other
palaeontologieal methods of correlation. Dominanee is here meant to include both
abundance of individuals and widespread occurrence at many localities. It is often
found that dominanee of a form or group of forms may be of time significanee even
though the form or forms occur in more limited numbers in both older and younger
rocks. In cases where a single form or several forms are dominant, a “zone'' may
be defined and named for the dominant form or forms.

6. Siinilarities of stratigraphic succession, though often unreliable criteria, may
contribute materially to eonclusions reached by pa1ae011tological methods of correla-
