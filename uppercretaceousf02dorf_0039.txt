LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN wroMING 115

There is no alternative but to conclude that at least a part of the Vermejo
deposits are of Lancian age. This at once suggests that it may be possible to show
that the typical Lancian species occur only in the upper part of the Vermejo forma-
tion. The stratigraphic position of some of the plant horizons in the Vermejo
formation has not been recorded. It is clear, however, that of the 14 species listed
above, the stratigraphic positions of 11 are known: all the 11 are in the upper Ver-
mejo and only 3 (Artocarpus dissecta, Cissites panduratus, and Palaeoaster inquirendo)
are reported also in beds which are questionably in the lower Vermejo. Ι believe
it just as significant to point out that the majority of the restricted Lancian species
listed above as occurring in the Vermejo are known elsewhere only in beds of lower
rather than upper Lancian age.

With respect to the restricted Montanan and pre-Montanan species present
in the Vermejo flora, it is difficult to determine whether these are relicts in a flora

of early Lancian age or are actually indicative of Montanan age for the lower part
of the formation. These species are as follows:

Brachyphyllum cf. B. macrocarpum Liriodendron alatum

Ficus regularis Pterospermites undulatus
Ficus rhamnoides Pterospermites wardii
Ficus? starkvillensis Widdringtonia‘? complanata

Ficus wardii

Disregarding szriodendron alatum, whose stratigraphic position in the Vermejo
formation is very much in doubt, 3 species (Ficus reqularis, F icus rhamnoides, and
Brachyphyllum cf. Β. macrocczrpum) are confined to the lower Vermejo, 2 species
(Pterospermitcs wardii and Widdrsinytofnia? complanata) are confined to the upper
Vermejo, and the remaining 3 are known in both the lower and the upper Vermejo.
This leads me to the conclusion that the lower Vermejo is of latest Montanan age,
as shown in figure 3, and that the upper Vermejo is of early Lancian age, during
which time a few Montanan species survived as relicts.

The Raton flora is a large flora of about 135 species which is Paleocene in general
aspect. It contains, however, an element (20 out of a total of about 70 species with
outside distribution) which is elsewhere restricted to Lancian age or older. This
element includes the following species, of which those marked by an asterisk are

definitely known only from the Raton and the Triceratops-bearing Arapahoe-Denver
or lower Dawson:

Allantodiopsis erosa Ficus planicostata
Anona‘? robusta Ficus? trinervis
*Artocarpus similis *Geonomites tenuirachis
*Castanea intermedia? Nelumbo tenuifolia
Cinnamomum linifolium Palaeoaster inquirenda
*Cissus coloradensis *Paloreodoxites plicatus
*Cissus grosse—dentata *Platanus rhomboidea
Cornophyllum wardii Pteris russelli
Dryophyllum subfalcatum Sabalites eocenica
*Ficus aquilar Viburnum marginatum

It has been possible to determine, from the report of Lee and Knowlton,¹ the
approximate position in the Raton formation of all but 4 of the species list-ed. Of
