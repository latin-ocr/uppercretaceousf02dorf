LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 103

may at once be observed from the totals of this table that the floral assemblage is
neither strictly cool temperate nor strictly tropical. Without exception, moreover,
the cool temperate and tropical distributions belong to genera which are known to
thrive-—often thrive best—also under warni temperate or subtropical conditions.
In contrast, the table shows that 16 01 1110 111οά0111 correlatives do not grow under
0001 10111ρο1010 conditions and 17 do not grow under tropical conditions, whereas all
the species are apparently at home in warm temperate or subtropical regions. The
slightly higher number 01 warm temperate correlatives would imply that the Lance
assemblage is more nearly warm temperate than subtropical. This conclusion is
precisely the conclusion reached on the basis 01 the leaf characters 01 1110 Lance
species. In this connection it should be noted that the dominants 01 1110 Lance
flora (p. 99) belong to genera which are warni temperate rather than subtropical
in modern distribution.

The above inferences regarding climate are supported by the fact that there
are a number of genera or families whose presence together in the Lance flora indi-
cates a lowland coastal-plain environment. These include Οαηνηαῖ), Τναραῖ, Soba-
lz'tes, and Pistia, all of whose modern relatives are typically restricted to or best
developed in the humid coastal lowlands of subtropical to warin temperate regions.

In summary it may be stated that the leaf characters and the distribution 01
111οά0111 correlatives of the Lance species, as well as the absence or scarcity 01 typi-
cally (3001 temperate genera, point to humid lowland conditions 01 growth under a
warm temperate to subtropical climate, more nearly approaching the former.

CORRELATION

General principles and methods—It must, I believe, be admitted that there is no
empirical quantitative means 01 exact correlation between rocks of different regions.
Certain fundamentals have, to be sure, gradually developed as guiding principles.l
But each investigator must carefully weigh, qualify, and modify each principle 111
the light 01 his own experience to suit the facts and conditions which he encounters.

In the present analysis, the principles which have been most applicable and
useful in the correlation of certain Upper Cretaceous deposits 01 the Rocky Moun-
tain region are as follows:

1. If two or more fossil assemblages are essentially identical‚ the rocks from
which they were obtained are considered contemporancous. This principle is not
considered infallible. In the first place, it must be remembered that a fossil as-
semblage is neither more nor less than a recovered sample of the remains 01 1110
living organisms which inhabited the region at the time 01 fossilization. All samples
are not necessarily fair samples; for example, some may bc too small. A small
assemblage of 20 species which are identical with 20 out of 30 species 01 0 second
assemblage is not necessarily contemporaneous with the second assemblage, if the
20 species happen to bc long-ranging types. In the second place, in view of the
element 01 chance involved both in the preservation of organisms and in the re-
