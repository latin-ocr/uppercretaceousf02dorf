eolleetions of the U. S. National Museum, where they were kindly made available to
me for the present study. My own larger collections of plants from the type Lance
were obtained during two weeks of the field season of 1936 and five weeks of 1938.

As is shown in figure 1, the type locality of the Lance formation is in eastern
Wyoming in the north—central part of Niobrara County (formerly the eastern part of
Converse County). It is referred to generally as the Lance Creek area and is the
loeation of the well-known Lance Creek oil field} The area lies within a radius of
5 miles northward of the town of Lance Creek and is 25 miles north-northwest of
Lusk‚ Wyoming.

The study of the Lance flora is a continuation of my program on Upper Cre-
taceous floras of the Rocky Mountain region, conducted under the auspices of the
C arnegie Institution of Washington and Princeton University. For their competent
assistance in the field I am indebted to H. H. Sharkey, K. Μ. Waage, F. D. Boiee,
and J. S. Shirk, students at Princeton University, and J. S. Eddy, of Lawrenceville
School. Suggestions and technical advice have been given by Dr. John B. Reeside
and Dr. Roland W. Brown, of the U. S. Geological Survey. Herbarium material
has been freely consulted at the New York Botanical Garden, whose staff has been
most helpful in offering suggestions regarding the systematic position of the fossil
plants. For his constructive eriticism of the manuscript Ι am particularly indebted
to Dr. Ralph W. Chaney, of the University of California.

EARLIER WORK IN THE AREA

The Lance Creek area was first brought to scientific attention by Hatcher,² who
had collected a large suite of dinosaur remains there between 1889 and 1895. Before
the publication of Hatcher’s paper Marsh had described several species of Triceratops
(originally called Ceratops) and other vertebrates from Hatcher’s collections; he had
failed, however, to specify the locality from which these specimens had been ob-
tained, other than that they were “from the Laramie ’' or “from the Ceratops beds of
Wyoming.” ³ It remained for Hatcher to locate the area, and to describe in detail
the lithologic characters and sketch the areal boundaries of the beds which had
yielded dinosaur remains. Regarding the stratigraphic position of the “Ceracops
beds,’' Hatcher stated: “All the beds of the entire section are conformable, and bear
evidence of a continuous deposition, from the Fort Pierre shales up through the Fox
Hills sandstones and the overlying fresh-water Ceratops beds.'' ⁴¹ Hatcher subse-
quently published two other short papers ⁵ which mentioned the Lance Creek area,
but did not add any data pertinent to the present report.

At about the same time, Stanton and Knowlton visited the Lance Creek area
and made collections of invertebrates and plants from both the “ Ceratops beds ” and
