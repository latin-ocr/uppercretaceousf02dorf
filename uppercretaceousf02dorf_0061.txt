LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 137

Examination of Brown’s type specimens at the U. S. National Museum has shown that the
leaves are actually remotely dentate, though the coarse sandy matrix makes this feature incon-
spicuous. There is no doubt in my mind, therefore, that the Lance Creek forms are referable
to the species described by Brown.

Knowlton had already encountered this type of leaf in his collections from the Lance Creek
area, which I have consulted at the U. S. National Museum. These were tentatively referred
by him to Sassasras sp. and Aralz'a sp. in his published lists, and to Aralz‘a n. sp. (specimen No.
1017) in the collections. All these specimens are essentially similar to those from my collection
and from Montana.

As was pointed out by Brown, there is a general resemblance between this species and
Araliopsoides cretacea (Newberry) Berry (= Sassasras cretaceum Newberry) from the Dakota,
Raritan, and Magothy floras.¹ There is also a resemblance to Aralia veatchii Knowlton from the
F rontier formation.² In both these species, however, there are differences from Plata'nophyllum
montanum in shape, venation, and marginal characters.

After consulting all available herbarium specimens of the living species of Sassasras at the
New York Botanical Garden, Ι am convinced that the Lance specimens of this species are not
referable to the genus Sassasras. In Sassasras leaves the 3 basal primaries are always suprabasilar,
the lobes are entire and rounded, and the venation is lauraceous in character. In the modern
Platanaceae‚ on the other hand, the leaves are more like the fossils here concerned in shape, vena-
tion, and marginal characters.

There are 4 well-preserved, though not complete, specimens from Locality P3652 which are
referable to this species. Unfortunately the specimens are so eurled in the matrix that they
cannot be adequately photographed and figured.

Lesquereux distinguished this species from Viburnum marqinatum Lesquereux by “the less
numerous, more open, lateral veins, whose branches are more curved in passing up to the borders,
and especially by the enlarged truncate or subtruncate base os the leaves.¹’ It may be added that
the coarse tertiaries, the large, obtuse teeth‚ and the presence of teeth along the basal edge of the
leaves are also diagnostic characters.

Outside of its type locality at Black Buttes, Wyoming, this species has been described and
figured from the Raton,³ the Denver,‘³ and the Laramie floras⁵ The Raton and Laramie speci-
mens do not have the diagnostic characters of the species and have been referred to Viburnum
maryinatum Lesquereux.⁶ The Denver specimen is a very inadequate one which does not, more-
over, have the truncate, enlarged basal characters of Platanophyllum platanoz'des.

One of the Fox Hills specimens which Brown referred to Platanus sp., which I have seen, is
believed to belong to this same species.

The platanoid character of these leaves is apparent. Following the trend of modern no-
menclators, it seems advisable, in the absence of definite proof, to refer the species to the less
positive genus Platanophyllum.
