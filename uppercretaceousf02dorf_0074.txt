There are 2 nearly complete specimens and several incomplete impressions which are essen-
tially similar to the type and figured specimens referred to this species. The specimen here
figured, though somewhat broken and wrinkled, shows the characteristic features of shape, size,
and venation. In a second specimen, from Locality P3857, the lobing is somewhat more pro-
nounced. A third specimen, from Locality P3859, previously identified as Cissites lobatus Dorf,¹
is now regarded as an incomplete specimen of Dombeyopsis trivialis.

At the present time this species is described or reported from only the Laramie, the Medicine
Bow‚ and the type Lance formatioris. It is not known to occur, or to be confused with any eom·
parable leaves, in beds of indisputable Paleocene age.

I am as yet uncertain of the relationship of this species to modern forms ; as previously pointed
out, the resemblance to the leaves of the modern Dombeya is remote.

Occurrence—Localities P3652, P3853, P3857, P3859.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal., Plesiotypes Nos. 2545, 2546, 2547.

About 30 well-preserved impressions of clearly defined leaves of this species were collected
from five of the Lance Creek localities. They differ in no essential details from the original types
and numerous figured specimens previously reported. A full description and discussion of this
species was given in my paper on the Medicine Bow flora, cited above. I have subsequently
encountered 5 excellent unlabeled specimens of this species in the Vermejo collection at the U. S.
National Museum (specimens Nos. 51287, 51288, 51289, 51290, 51293).

It is becoming increasingly more apparent that Viburnum marqinatum is an ideal index
species sor Lancian age in the Rocky Mountain region. The widespread occurrences of this
species are confined to the sediments lying conformably above the beds os the Fox Hills or late
Pierre age and below the non-dinosaur-bearing “Fort Union.” In terms of dinosaurian zones,
V. marqinalum is restricted to thc Triceratops zone. Geographically the species is distributed
from southern Colorado to as far north as southern Saskatchewan. Its remains, moreover, are

usually abundant and its characters are well defined and easily recognized.
