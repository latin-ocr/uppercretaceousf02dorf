152 CONTRIBUTIONS ’10 PALAEONTOLOGY

The genus Apeibopsis was originally defined by Heer ¹ on the basis of globular, capsular
fruits and large, ovate, entire-margined leaves. Both the fruits and the leaves were said to
resemble those os the living Apeiba Aubl„ 01 tropical America. In his original discussion 01
Apeibopsis? discolor, Lesquereux questioned the reference to Apeibopsis of Heer and remarked
that he could not compare either his specimens or those 01 Η661 to any living species of Apeiba.

Aralia taurinensis (Ward) Sanborn, Carnegie Inst. Wash. Pub. N 0. 465, I, 27, pl. 10, figs. 1, 2, 4, 1935.

There are only 5 specimens in the Lance Creek collections which are referable to this species.
Although the figured specimen is lacking most of the left 11611 01 the leaf, its restored shape and
its venation and marginal characters are essentially similar to the characters of the figured and
type specimens 01 Celastrus taurinensis from the “Fort Union’' formation. All the type and
figured specimens of the 61166166 here cited, moreover, are of the same character.

As was pointed out in my discussion of the Medicine Bow specimens referred to this species,
it is unfortunate that leaf impressions of this form are rare in the Lance-Laramie floras. Only a
larger suite of better-preserved specimens could settle the point as to whether or not the more
lanceolate shape of the late Cretaceous examples is consistent enough to be used as a specific
feature 01 distinction from the abundant Paleocene forms.

The uncertain botanical affinity of this 61166166 1166 116611 pointed out in my previous report.

Cinnamomum? affine Lesquereux

This species is represented in the collections by the single complete figured specimen and
several fragments. Although somewhat larger than the type and figured specimens of this species,
the Lance Creek specimen does not differ otherwise in the essential characters of shape, venation,
and margin. As in the specimens from the Medicine Bow and Colgate floras, the indistinct pair
01 veins below the lateral primaries appears to be a rather constant feature 01 the larger leaves 01
this species. This feature has also been observed recently on a Laramie specimen reserable to
this species.²

As has been previously pointed out, the resemblance os the leaves 01 this species to those
of the modern genus Cinnamomum is not very close. It does not seem advisable, however, to
make any change 01 name until 6 positive generic or family relationship is found.
