Zizyphus ripleyensis Berry. Dori, Bull. Geel. Soc. Amen, vol. 51, 218, 222, 225, 1940.

The reported presence of Zizyphus ripleyensis in the Lance Creek collection was based on
the specimen shown in plate 17, figure 9. The recent discovery of a second specimen of precisely
similar venation shows, however, that this leaf form is not lanceolate, as might be surmised from
figure 9, but is distinctly ovate, as shown in figure 14. This precludes the possibility of its identity
with the Ripley species, which is consistently lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate.

I have been unable to find any other described fossil species, either in the Cretaceous 01· in
the Tertiary, which has the characters here observed. The inadequate Laramie specimen of
Zizyphus coloradensis Knowlton ¹ is comparable, but lacks the secondary veins along the midrib,
which are so characteristically defined in the Lance Creek specimens.

Phyllites sp.
(Plate 17, Figs. 5, 13)

There are several fragmentary leaf impressions from two localities which are of a different
form from any others in the Lance Creek collections. The figured specimens show the upper
part of a leaf with numerous parallel secondaries ending in a doubly serrate margin. Other poorly
preserved impressions indicate that these leaves are ovate-lanceolate and asymmetrical at the
base. This combination of leaf characters suggests ulmaceous affinities. It is unfortunate that
the lack of adequate material prevents a full description. In observable features there is a sug-
gestion of resemblance to the Denver specimen referred to Ulmus antecedens Lesque1·eux‚² and to
the Baton specimen of Ulmus sp.³

Phyllites sp.
(Plate 17, Fig. 16)

The figured specimen is the only one of this kind in the Lance collections. I had tentatively
regarded it as rather closely similar to the specimen from the Dakota sandstone referred to
Populus microphylla Newberry.⁴ Recently, however, Brown has re-examincd the Dakota speci-
men and states that after cleaning it “shows numerous small teeth instead of the large teeth as
illustrated.” ⁵ The general shape and venation of the Lance specimen is suggestive of some of
the aberrant leaves of Cercidiphyllum arcticum (Heer) Brown,¹³ yet the extraordinarily large teeth
are not to be seen in any figured specimens of that species.

I have not cncountered any modern leaves with which this specimen can be compared.
