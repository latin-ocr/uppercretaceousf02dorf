there is little lithologie distinction between beds that contain characteristic Lance species and
others that contain characteristic Fox Hills species, and in these places the fossils must be made
the chief rcliance for separating the formations.'' ¹

In keeping with these suggestions, the following criteria for the practical de-
limitation of the F ox Hills sandstone in northeastern Colorado were subsequently
published by a committee of the Rocky Mountain Association of Petroleum Geolo-
gists after a field conference with Dr. Reeside:

“The base of the F ox Hills formation shall be considered as the horizon below which the
scction is predominantly gray marine clay shales and sandy shales of Pierre age, and above which
the section changes rapidly to a buff to brown sandstone containing numerous large gray to brown,
hard sandy concretions. This lower eoncretionary member is commonly overlain by a series of
light gray to brown sandstones and sandy shales.

“The top of the Fox Hills formation shall be considered as the horizon above which the sec-
tion is composed predominantly of fresh and brackish-water deposits accompanied by coals and
lignitic shales, and below which it is predominantly marine.’' ²

Attempts by our field party to apply these practical criteria to the section in the
Lance Creek area showed that the Fox Hills sandstone, though somewhat variable
in thickness, averages about 250 to 350 feet in thickness, as has also been shown by
Dobbin and Reeside.³ The greater thicknesses reported by earlier writers are ap-
parently the result of the inclusion in the F ox Hills of several massive, gray sand-
stones (Colgate equivalent?) which in places lie above the typical, fossiliferous F ox
Hills beds. These massive sandstones are locally present in the Lance Creek area,
where they have the following characteristics: (1) they are lenticular bodies of sand,
which were traced laterally along the strike from just east of Locality P3652 into the
typical dull-gray sandy shales, lignites, and plant—bearing gray sandstones of the
lower Lance formation at Locality P3853 ς (2) they contain a well-defined lignite bed
above the lowest massive sandstone, as well as several lignite lenses higher up; (3)
they contain no marine invertebrates, (4) locally they have yielded both dinosaur
remains and impressions of land plants; and (5) they resemble more closely the
lenticular sandstones of the overlying Lance succession than any beds of the true
Fox Hills. On the basis of the criteria set forth above, these massive sandstones
are not considered a part os the Fox Hills formation.

The following section, measured by Stanton ⁴² at the mouth of Lance Creek, is
typical of the Fox Hills sandstonc in this region, and shows the relation of the mas-
sive sandstones, which were regarded by Stanton as upper Fox Hills, to the beds
below.
