Remains of this characteristic leaf, which are abundant in several other floras of similar age,
are conspicuously rare in the Lance Creek collections. Only 3 fragmentary specimens have been
obtained ; one of these from this region is in the collections of the U. S. National Museum (specimen
No. 40257). This was probably the specimen on which Knowlton had previously reported the
occurrence os this species in the Lance Creek area.¹

A full description and a discussion of the possible relationships of M yrica torreyi has pre-
viously been given in my report on the Medicine Bow flora, cited above. A persistent search
among living species for leaves like those of this well-defined form has failed to disclose further
comparisons. The continued retention of the generic name M yrica, with its definite implication
of relationship to this modern genus, is therefore not considered warranted. The change to the
name M yrtophyllum is believed to be substantiated by comparison with leaves of the living Myr-
taceae.

The specimen here figured and its counterpart were the only ones of this form encountered.
A comparison with the type and figured specimens of Ficus artocarpoides and Cornus sosteri indi-
cates a striking similarity in all details. The specimens of Ficus preartocarpoides recorded by
Brown from the Hell Creek flora of Montana are equally comparable, except that some of his
larger specimens have distinct lobelike teeth, usually above the middle on one side of the leaf.
This occasional occurrence of short lobelike teeth on otherwise entire-margined leaves is often
met with in members of the Araliaceae, especially in Anomopanaa: cuminyz'anus (Presl) Merrill
(New York Botanical Garden, sheet No. 1108). Ι have not seen this type of marginal variation
in any species of Ficus or Cornus, so have accordingly changed the generic name of this leaf type
to Aralz'aephyllum, implying a family relationship to the existing Araliaceae.

As here interpreted‚ this species is at present known from the type Lance, the Hell Creek,
and the Fort Union floras. Brown has recently suggested additions to the synonymy of this
species,² including specimens from the Paskapoo and Ravenscrag formations of Canada. The
Lance Creek specimens are unfortunately not sufficiently complete in the apical region to verisy
Brown’s suggestions. The specimens from the Wilcox and Raton sormations which have been
referred to this species ³ seem to me to have a different type of venation, lacking branches on the
lower sides of the secondaries.
