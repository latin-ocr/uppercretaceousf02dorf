skz'oldi Heer and Trapa? vm‘crophylla Lesquereux, were found to be valid; both of
these species are, however, long-ranging forms of little value for correlation.

Although the obviously mixed collection of Lance Creek specimens did not add
any appreciable weight to his argument, Knowlton was by this time thoroughly
convinced by accumulated evidence from elsewhere that the flora of the “Ceratops
beds ⁷' and their supposed equivalents elsewhere could not be distinguished from the
F ort Union flora. The stratigraphic misconceptions which led him to this conclu-
sion have been discussed elsewhere.¹

Thc “ Ceratops beds” of the Lance Creek area were discussed again in the same
year by Sta11ton,‘-’ who reiterated his opinion regarding the Cretaceous age of the
beds as determined by their stratigraphic relations, their vertebrates, and their
invertebrates. In the following year, stanton first applied the name Lance forma-
tion to the “ Ceratops beds,'’ as follows:

“The name Lance formation has reeently been adopted by the United states Geological
Survey for the ‘Ceratops beds' of eastern Wyoming and adjacent areas, It is an abbreviated
form of the term ‘ Lance Creek beds’ which J. B. Hatcher applied to these deposits . . . with the
statement that the name is taken ‘from the prineipal stream in the region where they are best
represented in Converse County, Wyoming.' '’ ³

In this report Stanton was primarily concerned with the stratigraphic relations of
the Lance formation. In the Lance Creek area, and elsewhere, he observed that
there was no evidence of an unconformity between the Lance and the underlying
Fox Hills sandstone, such as had been postulated by some geologists. He pointed
out also that the Fox Hills sandstone of the Lance Creek area was somewhat thicker
than had previously been determined, and estimated the thickness of the Lance
formation at 2100 to 2200 feet.

Within the next few years the controversy concerning the Cretaceous—Tertiary
boundary in the western interior reached its climax. The Lance Creek area, how-
ever, was no longer the focus of attention. In 1911 Knowlton ‘¹ described a new
species from his Lance Creck collections but did not discuss further the question of
the age of the flora. In 1912 Winchester ⁵ described a section from the Pierre shale
to the F ort Union in the Lance Creek area, in which the Lance formation was esti-
mated to bc 2539 feet thick. Collections of invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants
were obtained from a number of localities. Problems of correlation were not dis-
cussed. The area was only briefly mentioned in connection with the symposium
on the “Close of the Cretaeeous and Opening of Eocene Time in North America'’
of 1913-1914.ὓ

In the summer of 1914 Lull visited the Lance Creek area, and subsequently he
published an excellent surnmary of the known vertebrato remains, both mammalian
and dinosaurian, which had by this time been collected from the Lance formation of
