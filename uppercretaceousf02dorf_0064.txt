Laurus ocoteoides Lesquereux, Rept. U. S. Gcol. Surv, Terr., vol. 7, 215, pl. 36, fig. 10, 1878, U. S. Geol. and
Geog. Surv. Terr., Ann. Rept. (1876), 510, 1878. [Homonym Laurus ocoleaeoidcs Massalongo, Syn. Fl.
Foss. Senogalliensis, 57, pl. 24, fig. 3, pl. 40, fig. 1, 1858.]

The nearly complete specimen figured here is the best of 3 specimens of this leaf form in the
eollections. These are clearly indistinguishable from the type and figured specimens of the
Laramie species originally referred by Lesquereux to Laurus ocoteoides, a name preoccupied by
Massalongo. The original description of this species was as follows:

“Leaf long, coriaceous, narrowly lanceolate, gradually tapering from below the middle
upward to an obtuse acumen, cuneate to the petiole; lateral veins thin, open, subequidistant,
close, slightly curved.¹’

Although the essential characters of the leaf of this species are well defined, the species is
apparently not a common form in the late Cretaceous of the Rocky Mountain region. It is
at present known only from a few specimens from each of the following formations: Laramie,
Hell Creek, Medicine Bow (?), lower Dawson (‘?)‚¹ and the type Lance. There is a similarity in
leaf form to the Laramie specimens referred to Ficus *navvz'cularz's Cockerell.² Both the figured
and the type specimens of this species indicate, however, striking differences in the areolated

tertla'rthggnss-ggls- little justification for the positive reference of this species to the modern genus

Laurus. As Berry has pointed out, these leaves “cannot be certainly distinguished from the
leaves of a number of existing genera such as Nectandra, Oreodaphne, and M espilodaphne.''

figs. 1—6a, 10, 11, 1939 (see complete synonymy).

There is a single complete specimen from Locality P3854 which I had previously regarded
as a variant of the normal leaf form of Phyllices colubrinoides. Since the excellent synthesis of
the late Cretaceous and Tertiary species os Cercidiphyllum by Brown, it has become evident that
the specimen is more properly considered within the rather wide range of variability of C. arcticum.
It cannot be separated on any rational basis, for example, from the specimens figured by Brown
on his plato 53, figure 6, nor from those figured by Berry from the Ravenscrag formation ³ of
Saskatchewan.

Leaves of this species are cxccedingly rare in the late Cretaceous scdiments of the Rocky
Mountain region. They are very abundant, on the other hand, in deposits of known Paleocene
age, such as the “Fort Union,'' Hanna, Paskapoo, and Ravenscrag.

Both Berry and Brown have pointed out the similarity of the leaves os this species to those
os Cercidiphyllum japonicum S. ἁ Ζ. of eastern Asia.
