age.¹ Here, then, is an opportunity to see what kind of floral analysis is derived
from an assemblage whose Montanan age is established by stratigraphic position
and adjacent marine saunas. Such an analysis should prove useful in the correla-
tion of other floral assemblages whose age is not so definitely established.

The Ericson-Almond species give the following analysis:

No outside distribution ..... 14
Outside distribution ........ 35 (14 in common with type Lance)
Total number of speeies. . . ᾖ
Short-ranging species: Long-ranging species: Species of uncertain range. . 3

This summary shows that out of a total of 35 species with outside distribution,
14 (40 per cent) are also found in the flora of the type Lance. This is in contrast
with the higher percentages seen in floras of known Lancian age and is comparable
with the figure for the Vermejo flora. The short-ranging species, however, are
overwhelmingly of typical Montanan age, as follows:

Montanan age only:

Ficus regularis Pterospermites wardii
Ficus rhamnoides Quercus dentonoides

Ficus squarrosa Trapa‘? cuneata

Ficus wardii Viburnum anomalinervum
Grewiopsis cleburni Widdringtonia‘? complanata

Pterospermites undulatus
Lancian age only:

Cornophyllum wardii Menispermites belli
Ficus crossii Selaginella‘? falcata

The age relations of the Ericson-Almond formatioris to other formatioris dis-
cussed are shown in figure 3.
