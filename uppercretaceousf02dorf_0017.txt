Localz'ty P3854. South bank of small valley, southwest corner of SE. ὲ sec. 15, T. 36 N.,
R. 65 W. (See plate 2, fig. 1.) A fair collection of leaves was obtained from a lens of dark-gray,
hard, calcareous siltstone, estimated to lie about 1000 feet above the base of the Lance formation:

Dryophyllum subfalcatum Salix lancensis

Ficus? trinervis Trapa? microphylla
Fraxinus leii Viburnum montanum
Grewiopsis saportana Woodwardia? crenata

Laurophyllum coloradensis

Localz'ty P3855. North bank of small valley, near center of SW. ὲ sec.. 13, T. 36 N., R. 65 W.
The following species were obtained from a bed of dull-gray, thinly bcdded siltstone, estimated to
be about 1200 feet above the base of the Lance:

Anona‘? robusta Magnoliophyllum cordatum
Carpites walcotti Phyllites sp.

Carpites sp. Platanophyllum montanum
Cissus? lobato-crenata Quercus? viburnifolia
Dryophyllum subfalcatum Sequoia dakotensis

Laurophyllum coloradensis Vitis stantoni

LocalitylP3856. Head of small valley, southeastern part of SW. ᾖ sec. 2, T. 36 N„ R. 65 W.
Only a few species were obtained, from a massive, buff to light-gray, soft claystone, estimated to
lie about 1600 feet above the base of the Lance. As nearly as can be determined, this is the same

locality as U. S. Geological Survey Locality 1462, referred to as “a clay bed . . . one and a half
miles southwest'⁷ of the U-L Ranch.¹ Only the following speeies were obtained:

Equisetum sp. Trapa? microphylla

Filicites knowltoni Typha sp.

Locality P3857. Middle of steep cliff along east bank of Lance Creek, center of SE. ὲ sec.
25, T. 37 N„ R. 65 W. (See plato 2, fig. 2.) Numerous plant remains occur in an irregular stra-
tum of dull-gray siltstonc in direct association with numerous well-preserved but fragile shells of
fresh-water invertebrates. This is the locality (U. S. Geological Survey Locality 1464) about
which Stanton and Knowlton remarked, “one of the best localities is in a bluff on the right bank
of the Lance Creek just below the U-L Ranch.” ² I obtained the following species from this
horizon, estimated to be about 1700 feet above the base of the Lance:

Apeibopsis? discolor Grewiopsis saportana
Cyperacites sp. Laurophyllum salicifolium
Dombeyopsis trivialis Magnoliophyllum cordatum
Dryophyllum subfalcatum Platanophyllum montanum
Fraxinus leii Quercus? viburnifolia
Ginkgo adiantoides? Rhamnus? minutus
