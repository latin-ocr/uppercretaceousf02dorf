The somewhat variable leaves of this species are not so abundant in the type Lance flora
as they are in the Medicine Bow and Denver. Only 9 specimens from three localities have been
found. The figured specimen, though not complete, shows the typical ovate-elliptic shape,
rounded base, and toothed margin which serve to distinguish this species from others. The
venation, which is known to be variable‚ is of precisely the character seen in several of the numerous
Medicine Bow specimens of this species in the Princeton and University of California collections.1
Numerous specimens from the Hell Greek formation in the collections of Princeton University
(Corbin collection) are also of precisely the same character.

Brown's recent studies of this and related species have shown that leaves of the form referred
to Cercidiphyllum ellipticum are widely distributed, and usually abundant, in the Upper Cretaceous
of the Northern Hemisphere. It is apparently also known, though of rare occurrence, in the early
Paleocene of North America.

The generic status of this species has been satisfactorily clarified by Brown's discovery of the
characteristic fruits and seeds of Cercidiphyllum in association with the leaves, which had already
previously been regarded as of the Cercidiphyllum form. Brown has found the leaves, fruits, and
seeds in association at no less than thirty localities in the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits
of the United States. In the Lance Creek collections there are associated fruits, hitherto called
Lequminosites arachioz'des minor, but none of the small winged seeds have been detected.

In the collection borrowed from the U. S. National Museum there is a single fairly complete
specimen which agrees in all essential details with the characters of the type specimens of Ν elumbo
tenuisolia. Berry has recently properly united N. lakesiana with the former species on the basis
of similarity of significant features.

As at present interpreted, this species is fairly widely distributed in the late Cretaceous sedi-
ments of the Rocky Mountain region and may possibly continue into the early Paleocene. It has
been reported on adequate material from the Laramie, Denver, and Raton formatioris of Colorado,
the Lance of Wyoming, and the Whitemud and middle Ravenscrag (P) of Saskatchewan. It is
