There are 3 nearly complete specimens of small, linear, coriaceous leaves which are similar
in essential details to the type and figured specimen of this Laramie species. Its resemblance to
Rhamnus salicisolius Lesquereux¹ has been pointed out by Knowlton, who noted, however, the
difference from that species in margin and tertiary venation. No other comparable leaves have
corne to my attention.

Although I can suggest no alternative, the generic reference of this species to Rhamnus is
open to question. I have seen no leaves of existing species of Rhamnus which are comparable in
observable details.

There are 35 well-preserved, detached leaflets, from five localities, which cannot be dis-
tinguished from the type and figured specimens of this widespread species. Knowlton has pre-
viously reported this species from the Lance Creek area, ² Ι have seen his excellent specimens in
the collections at the U. S. National Museum (specimens No. 1003 [1462D.

Both Berry and Brown have discussed the uncertain systematic status of this species and
have fully described its well-defined characters. Leaflets of this form are widespread and abun-
dant in rocks of both Late Cretaceous and Paleocene age in the Rocky Mountain region.

Phyllites trifoliatus Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 17, Figs. 3, 4)
Lysimachia sp., Knowlton, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., vol. 11, 207, 1909.

There is 3 single specimen and counterpart, borrowed from the U. S. National Museum,
which is unlike anything else seen in the collections. There are, moreover, no fossil species in
either Cretaceous or Tertiary floras with which the specimen can be compared.

Description—Leaves apparently arranged in trifoliate manner; individual leaflets broadly
ovate to elliptic, 1.8—3.9 cm. long by 1—1.5 cm. wide; margins entire; bases and tips acutely wedge-
shaped; venation pinnate with 4-6 pairs of subopposite secondaries, coming off the midribs at
acute angles and arching sharply upward, becoming essentially parallel to the 1nidribs at their
distal ends ; tertiary venation very fine, indistinct; texture apparently fairly thick.

I have been unable to find any modern leaves which resemble this species. It may be that
the trifoliate arrangement is more apparent than real, so that the leaflets are actually a whorl of
spirally arranged leaves of a type seen, for example, in various members of the family Primulaceae.
Until better specimens of this species are obtained, however, it seems best not to make a definite
generic assignment.
