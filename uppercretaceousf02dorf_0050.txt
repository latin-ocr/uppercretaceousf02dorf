There are 3 specimens in the collections which are similar in all essential characters to the
figured and type specimens of this speeies. In plate 4, figure 3 are shown the delicate pinnules
borne alternately on a slender pinna. The details of the venation and margins are shown in the
enlarged pinnules, figures 1 and 2.

The general shape, size, and venation of these pinnules are suggestive of Hymenophsyllum
confusum Lesquereux from the Denver flora; ¹ this may be distinguished, however, by the decurrent
extension os the pinnules along the pinnae, a character not seen in any of the known specimens of
Aspleniles tenellum.

The original type specimens of A. tenellum were obtained from the Montana group (Mesa-
verde formation) os southeastern Wyoming. It has since been encountered only in the Colgate
flora of eastern Montana and in the type Lance of the present report.

Although these pinnules are undeniably similar to those of several living speeies of Asplenz'um,
it seems advisable to refer this species to the less positive Asplenites, at least until specimens of
fertile parts are discovered.

There are 6 specimens os sern fragments which Ι cannot distinguish from the type and
described specimens of this species. As is shown in the fragments here figured, the pinnules are
distinctly crenate and the venation is precisely as in the original type. The absence os finer
serrations in the Lance Creek specimens is not considered sufficiently important for specifie sepa-
ration, in view of the variatione of this kind noted in pinnules of modern ferns.

I have questioned the reference os this species to the genus Woodwardia. There is, to be
sure, a resemblance to several living species of this genus, but there is also resemblance to the
living Onoclea. A definite generic reference can probably not be made until fruiting organs have
been found in attachment to pinnules of this form.
