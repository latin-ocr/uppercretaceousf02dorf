Several hundred specimens of this long—leaved conifer and associated cone scales were ob-
tained, mainly from Locality P3853. About 150 specimens were retained for study. The re-
covery of so large a suite of specimens, showing many stages of growth and varieties of preserva-
tion, has made it possible to show that the several species cited above are in reality referable to a
single species. The specific name lonyzsssolia has priority over the others.

As was pointed out by Knowlton,¹ the original type specimens of Sequoia lonqisolia were
described by Lesquereux from the Mesaverde formation at Point of Rocks, Wyoming. The

original description was as follows:

“Branches and branchlets thick; leaves close, open, slightly narrowed to the decurring base,
thick; scars deep, Iigulate, obtusely pointed, marked by a deep groove in the middle.''

The Lance Creek foliage specimens clearly agree with this description and are indistinguish-
able from the original type and figured specimens. None of these, moreover, differ in any valid,
essential detail from the specimens from Black Buttes which were called Sequoia acuminata.
Lesquereux recognized the close resemblance of these specimens to S. lonyisolia and hesitated to
describe the two species as distinct. They apparently differed only in the absence of scars on the
branches of S. acuminata. From the numerous specimens available in the Lance Creek collections
it is evident that leaf scars are often concealed by flattened leaf bases; accordingly, the absence of
leaf scars in the Black Buttes specimens is here regarded as fortuitous.

The Mesaverde (?) specimens of Geim'tzz'a lonqisolia and szmm‘nyhamites? sp. were included
in the species chuoia lonqzjolia by Knowlton ² on what appear to be justifiable grounds. Nor is
there any discernible difference in the Mesaverde and Vermejo specimens which Knowlton referred
to Geinitzia formosa Heer. Knowlton characterized these specimens in part by thc- alternation
of the normal needles “with smaller intermediate scalelike leaves.” The type specimens do not
bear out this observation; the apparent smaller leaves are merely the hasal parts of longer leaves
which are cut off by projection into the matrix or out to the fracture plane along which the rock
was split.

The intimate association of a great many individual cone scales with the hundreds of speei-
mens of the foliage of this type, coupled with the absence os other conifer foliage or cone scales at
these localities, makes it reasonably certain that these two types of remains belong to the same
specics of conifer. These cone scales (plate 5, figs. 2-6) are identical with the type specimen and
with more complete, unfigured specimens ³ of Dammara sp.‚ from the Laramie formation at
Marshall, Colorado. As at the Lance Creek localities, these Laramie cone scales were associated
at the Marshall locality with foliage referred to Sequoia lonqisolia. A similar occurrence of this
type of cone scale and foliage has been noted in a collection from the Hell Creek formation at the
