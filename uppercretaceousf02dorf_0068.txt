The collections contain 6 impressions os cordate-orbicular leaves which differ only in an
additional pair of secondaries along the midrib from the type and figured specimen of Menisper-
mites kniqhtz'i. The original description was as follows:

“Leas evidently thick in texture, broadly cordate, with roundcd base and very deep sinuses‚
rounded, truncate at apex ; margin undulate lobed, the lobes very short, obtuse, and entire or
erose; nervation palmate, with about seven primary nerves os equal strength which apparently
pass to the rounded lobes or are once or twice forked, the branches passing to the lobes; finer

nervation not preserved.'’

The observable characters of this leaf form resemble those of several menispermaceous genera,
particularly Caeculus. On the other hand, the thick texture is suggestive of an aquatic leaf.
Among aquatic genera there is a marked resemblance to several of the Nymphaeaceae, particularly
Castalia (Nymphaea). These differ, however, in minor respects, mainly in their more numerous
secondaries and in their deeply cordate bases. In the absence of better comparison with modern
leaves, it seems advisable to retain the more general name applied by Knowlton.

This species is at present known only from the Lance formation and the Mesaverde formation
os southeastern Wyoming.

This species is not abundant in the collections. Only 4 specimens of incomplete, though
well-preserved, leaves were encountered. The general shape‚ the cordate base, and the prominent
secondaries with pronounced marginal loops are sufficiently well shown, however, to permit the
determination without hesitation.

I have not as yet encountered specimcns or figures of previously reported leaves of this form
in the Cretaceous or early Tertiary floras, aside from those of the Medicine Bow flora. The re-
semblance of these forms to the leaves of the Magnoliaceae has already been discussed in the
original description of this species.

There are 3 specimcns, from two localities, which cannot be distinguished from any of the
various type and figured specimens of this species from the Medicine Bow and Laramie formations.

Both the fossil and modern relationships of this species have already been adequately dis-
cussed in the reports citcd above.

Occurrence—Localities P3651, P3859.
