LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN wr0M1NG 159

This clearly defined species is represented in the collection by the figured specimen and several
fragments from Locality P3854. The figured specimen has all the essential characteristics of the
type and figured specimens of Palaeoascer inquirenda from the Vermejo and Raton formations.
The number of segments is apparently somewhat more variable than is implied in the original
description. The Lance Creek specimen has 14 segments, a feature which Ι do not consider
sufficiently important to maintain the specimen as a distinct species.

The botanical status of this species is still doubtful. Knowlton has mentioned its general
resemblance to the flowers of Calycanthus, Maynolz'a, and Wz‘lliamsonia, and to the fruits of
Liriodendron. The Dawson (?) specimen referred to Sterculiocarpus coloradensis Berry, which is
probably conspecific with Palaeoaster inquirenda, is regarded as sterculiaceous.¹

Remains of this species are now known in the Vermejo, lower Medicine Bow, Laramie, and
lowermost Raton floras, besides being present in the true Lance of both Wyoming and Montana.

Occurrence—Locality P3854.

Colleclion—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Plesiotype No. 2582.
