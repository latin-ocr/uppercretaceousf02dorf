There are 2 fairly complete specimens in the collections which are indistinguishable in essen-
tial details from the figured and type specimens of this species, known previously only from the
Laramie formation.

After eonsulting several hundred genera of living forms, one has little doubt, as Knowlton
has already stated, as to the close similarity between these fossil leaves and those of several existing
species of Aristolochia. Knowlton has pointed out the resemblance to A. clematis Linne and
A. hirta Linne of the Old World and to the American A. tomentosa Sims. I have noted also an
agreement in essential details with the leaves of A. qiqantea M. and Z., at the New York Botanical
Garden.¹ In the absence of positive proof os generic identity‚ however, it seems advisable to
refer this species to Aristolochites, implying family relationship to the modern Aristolochiaeeae.

There is a single nearly complete specimen and several fragmentary impressions which are
indistinguishable from the type and figured specimens listed above. In the discussion of this
leaf form in the Medicine Bow flora, Ι stated that the incomplete specimens were “referred with
doubt¹' to Laurus socialis. It was noted that in the type specimens of that speeies “the shape is
more lanceolate and the secondaries are more numerous more obtuse, and less prominently looped
near the borders.'' With the more complete material now at hand in the Lance collections, it is
certain that these well-defined leaves are not referable to Laurus socialis. The type specimen of
Anona coloradensis from the Laramie formation is, on the other hand, more clearly defined than
its reproduction implies, and is not distinguishable from the Dawson and Medieine Bow specimens
which were alleged to be Laurus socialis. The specimen previously identified as Juqlans leconteana
Lesquereux ² comes from the same locality as the specimen of Laurophyllum coloradensis here
figured and is not now regarded as sufficiently distinct to warrant separation from the latter
species.

In his description of Anona coloradensis, Knowlton noted a resemblance to the living Anona
palmeri Safford of Mexico, but observed that there were usually fewer seeondaries in the fossil
speeimens. After eonsulting the leaves os all available species of Anona at the New York Botani-
cal Garden, Ι am convineed that this comparison is rather remote. As was pointed out in my
Medicine Bow report‚³ these sossil specimens resemble more closely such lauraceous genera as
Persea and Laurus. It has therefore seemed inore advisable to refer these forms to the genus
Laurophyllum, indicating a similarity to the leaves of the Lauraeeae.
