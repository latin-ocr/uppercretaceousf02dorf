There are 4 well-preserved specimens which were misidentified as Ficus crossiz' because of
their similarity to the Laramie specimen which Knowlton had referred to that species. Ι had
previously regarded the Laramie specimen as more probably referable to Rhamnus qoldz‘anus
Lesquereux¹ and certainly not to Ficus crossiz‘. On the basis of further studies with the type
specimens at the U. S. National Museum, however, it has become evident that the Laramie
specimen, as well as those of the type Lance, cannot be distinguished from the type specimens of
Laurophyllum meeki or its synonymous forms. The leaves of Rhamnus qoldianus were found to
be uniformly of thinner texture, with more closely spaced secondaries and with more numerous,
parallel tertiaries.

As here interpreted, Laurophyllum meeki is known from the Black Buttes, Medicine Bow,
Laramie, and type Lance floras. Its resemblance to existing lauraceous leaves has already been
pointed out in my original discussion of the species.

This well-defined leaf form is rare in the Lance Creek collections, being represented by only
5 specimens from three localities. A full description and discussion of this species has been given
in my report on the Medicine Bow flora. The inclusion of the specimens of Laurus lanceolata
in this species is here made on the basis of further consultation of the collections at the U. S. Na-
tional Museum. These collections were found to contain also the following unidentified speci-
mens which I believe belong to this species: 1 nearly perfect specimen in the Laramie collection
(No. 130), and 3 specimens in the Vermej0 collection (Nos. 34502, 51154, 254). The species was
reported and figured previously from both these formations.

As I have previously pointed out, these fossil leaves are distinctly not rhamnaceous, but are
difficult to distinguish from several living species of Persea and N ectandra of the Lauraceae. The
resemblance to this family is accordingly indicated by referring the species to the genus Lauro-
phyllum.
