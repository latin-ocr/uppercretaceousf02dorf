Fort Union Group

The deposits above the Lance formation have been generally referred to the
F ort Union “formation’' on the basis of stratigraphic position, lithology, absence of
dinosaurs, and the presence of a typical Lower Eocene (Paleoeene) flora.l The
contact between the typical Lance formation and the lowest unit of the Fort Union
group has been discussed under the Lance formation. This contact is traceable
northward into the Gillette coal field region, where it coincides, so far as Ι can deter-
mine, with the contact between the Hell Creek and Tullock formations.2 The T ul-
lock formation was regarded by Dobbin and Barnett, as elsewhere by others, as the
upper member of the Lance formation. In the Gillette coal field, as well as at its
type locality and elsewhere, the Tullock formation is now known to contain plant
remains of typical Paleocene Fort Union aspect.3 This conclusion is substantiated
by the southward extension of the Tullock of the Gillette coal field into the Fort
Um'on beds above the top of the Lance formation, as defined, in the Lance Creek
area. It is evident, therefore, that the lower unit of the Fort Union group of the
Lance Creek area is equivalent to the Tullock formation, which is traceable from
its type locality in eastern Montana into the area of the Gillette coal field.4

The lithologic characters of the “Tullock'’ formation in the Lance Creek area
are in distinct contrast with those of the type Lance. Sandstones are thin, yel-
lowish, finegrained, and fairly hard. They are more persistent than the sandstones
of the Lance formation and form a fairly prominent suceession of low scarps which
stand above the rolling, subdued lowlands developed on the Lance formation. The
