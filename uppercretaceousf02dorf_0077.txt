Cissus? lobato-crenata Lesquereux

Cissus labano-cranam Lesquereux, Rept. U. S. Geol. Surv. Terr.‚ vol. 7, 240, pl. 41, figs. 1κὸ, 1878, Knowlton,

There are 3 specimens, of which the best is figured, which are referable to this species. Its
original description by Lesquereux was as follows:

‘⁴ Leaves subeoriaceous, subcordate at the base, broadly enlarged above it, rapidly narrowed
to an obtuse point, crenate and short-lobed all around, three-nerved from the base, primax-y and
secondary nerves branching, all the divisions craspedodrome.”

As is shown in the figured specimen, the Lance Creek specimens differ from the original
description, and from the type specimens, only in their wedge-shaped rather than subcordate
bases. In view of the variations expected and observed in the leaves of living species, this slight
difference is not considered sufficient sor specific distinction. The general shape, the venation,
and the obtusely lobed crenate margins are here regarded as the usable diagnostic features of
the leaves of this species.

In addition to its occurrence in the type Lance formation, this species has previously been
recorded in the Black Buttes, lower Dawson, and Middle Park floras. There is also an excellent
unreported specimen of it in the Laramie collection at the U. S. National Museum.¹

Ι have not been able to find any leaves of living species of either Cissus or any other genus
which bear a close resemblance to those of Cissus? lobaco-crenata.

I was not successful in obtaining specimens of these sruits in the Lance Creek area. Knowl-
ton, however, made a considerable collection of them from this same region and from the true
Lance (Hell Creek formation) of eastern Montana. He at first regarded these as the seeds of a
palm, but subsequently compared them to the fruits of Ficus. I have examined Knowlton’s
specimens in the collections at the U. S. National Museum, but can offer no further suggestions
as to their botanical affinities. Brown has recently made a large collection of these figlike casts
from the Hell 01661( formation of Montana. He suggests that they may be the underground
tubers of Equisetum. This is a tenable view, but is not fully supported by the appearance and
character of true attached Equisetum tubers in the Lance Creek flora (plate 6, fig. 3) ; these differ
considerably from the specimens of Ficus? ceratops in shape and surface markings.

To my knowledge, the only occurrence of this species outside the Lance formation of Wyo-
ming and Montana is in the Whitemud formation of Saskatchewan, as reported by Berry.
