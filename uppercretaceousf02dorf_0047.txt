LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 123

designation but are not specifically determinable. Most of the species are regarded
as only distantly related to existing genera. Some of the species are still of very
uncertain systematic position ; others have been systematically revised or described
in detail on the basis of better and more abundant specimens and of comparisons
with modern plants. A quantitative analysis of the plant remains indicates that
10 species may be regarded as the dominants of the floral association.

Studies of the structural characters of the dicotyledonous leaves in the Lance
flora indicate lowland, humid‚ warm temperate conditions of growth, approaching
subtropical. This conclusion is substantiated by the present distribution of modern
correlatives of the Lance species.

For purposes of correlation the Lance formation at its type locality is made the
basis of a new provincial time term, “ Lancian age.'' This time unit is regarded, on
the basis of the stratigraphic position and palaeontology of the type Lance formation,
as latest Cretaceous, i.e., post-Montanan and pre-Paleocene.

Analyses of other late Cretaceous floras of the Rocky Mountain region indicate
that (1) the Laramie, Medicine Bow, and Colgate—Hell Creek formations are of
Lancian age, as is shown also by their stratigraphic position and by other fossil
remains; (2) the Arapahoe—lower Denver, lower Dawson‚ upper Vermejo—lower
Baton, and Whitemudsslower Ravenscrag formations and the so-called “ Laramie''
of southwestern Wyoming are also of Lancian age; (3) the Almond-Ericson‚ Mesa-
verde, lower Vermejo, and Fruitland formations are of late Montanan age.

Analyses of Paleocene floras indicate that: (1) the floras of the type Fort Union
formation or other undoubted Paleocene beds have less than 10 per cent of their
species in common with the type Lance flora or other floras of Lancian age; (2)
the floras of the type Tullock and Ludlow beds and equivalents are closely related
to the Paleocene Fort Union flora and have little in common with Lancian floras.

The placing of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary below the Tullock, Ludlow,
and demonstrable equivalents and above the Hell Creek and Lance is consistent

with the recent discovery of Paleocene foraminifera in the Cannonball beds of the
Dakotas.
