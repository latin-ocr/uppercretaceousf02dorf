Α5 has already been pointed out in my report on the Medicine Bow flora, its
resemblance to the Lance flora is striking. Out of a total of 51 species with outside
distribution, it has 28 species (55 per cent) in common with the type Lance flora.
Its reference to Lancian age is amply corroborated by a study of its component
short-range species. Not a single species has previously been known only from
deposits of Montanan or Paleocene age. In contrast, there are 26 (51 per cent)
which have been found previously only in deposits of Lancian age, as follows:

Apeibopsis? laramiensis
Carpites walcotti
Cinnamomum? affine
Cinnamomum linifolium
Cissites lobatus
Dombeyopsis trivialis
Dryopteris? carbonensis
Ficus coloradensis
Ficus eowanensis
Grewiopsis saportana
Juglans leconteana

J uglans newberryi
Juglans praerugosa

Laurophyllum coloradensis
Laurophyllum meeki
Magnolia dakotana
Magnolia lakesii
Magnoliophyllum cordatum
Menispermites eockerelli
Palaeoaster inquirenda
Pisonia? racemosa
Pistacia eriensis

Sabalites eocenica
Viburnum marginatum
Zingiberites dubius
Zizyphus hendersoni

The temporal relations of the Medicine Bow formation, as here interpreted,
are shown in figure 3. The inclusion of the upper Medicine Bow and overlying
lower Ferris in the Lancian age 15 based entirely on the reported presence of Tm?-
ceratops remains in these beds. No plants are now known from this part of the
sequence.

Laramie-Denver-Dawson floras—The flora of the Laramie formation of the
Denver basin of Colorado has been described by Knowlton.l Although I believe
it is somewhat overspeciated, there are apparently about 100 recognizable species.
The plant-bearing beds lie between the Sphenocliscus-bearing Fox Hills sandstone
below and the top of the Triceratops zone of the overlying Arapahoe and lower
Dawson 1011113110115,2 and are thus clearly of Lancian age. The testimony of the
floral assemblage, even without other evidence, supports the same conclusion on
