tion. This principle is best applied to unfossiliferous rocks occurring above, below,
or between rocks containing datable fossil assemblages, It does not imply that
dissimilarities of stratigraphic succession preclude the possibility of correlation.

7. Exact correlation of fossil assemblages does not necessarily include exact age
determination unless 0110 01 another of the assemblages has been properly placed in
the geologic time scale. Although sometimes forgotten, this principle is obviously
fundamental in all problems of correlation, since the geologic time scale is an arbi-
trary and empirical classification based in the first instance on superposition rather
than on fossi] content. There are known instances in which diverse fossil assem-
blages have been proved synchronous yet cannot be accurately assigned to a definite
position in the time scale because of their isolation from rocks 01 known age.

the identifications 01 1110 fossils used.

Lance flora as a standard—The Lance flora, herein described, is an excellent
standard flora with which to compare and contrast other late Cretaceous and early
Tertiary floras of the Rocky Mountain region. It is composed of specirnens which
were all collected from the type locality of the Lance formation. It is a compara—
tively large flora, comprising 70 species, 01 which 57 have an outside distribution.
It is accurately dated in terms 01 1110 geologic time scale (aside from its own floral
testimony), since it occurs in beds which have yielded abundant remains of dino—
saurs 01 the Triceratops zone 01 latest Cretaceous age and which are conformably
above the Sphcnodiscus zone of true Fox Hills (latest Montanan) age. It also con-
tains a sufficient number of index species of short stratigraphic range elsewhere to be
reliable for correlation. Finally, the stratigraphic succession and the relation of the
floral assemblage to the Triceratops zone and to the Sphenodiscus zone in this region
are strictly comparable with the conditions observed in several other regions.

Defi'nition of Lancian aye—There does not exist at present a clearly defined
tempora] term for the latest Cretaceous of the Rocky Mountain region. For the
practica] purposes 01 clarity and precision it is here proposed to use Lancian age as a
convenient provincial time term, based on the Lance formation at its type locality
near Lance Creek, Niobrara County, Wyoming. This time unit is delimited below
by true Fox Hills time (i.e.‚ latest Montanan age, characterized by marine sand-
stones comprising the well-defined Sphenodiscus zone), and delimited above by the
beginning of Paleocene time. The terrestrial sediments 01 Lancian age carry the
characteristic mammals¹ and dinosaurs 2 of the Triceratops zone, as well as the plants
here described.

Lance flora—As is shown in table 3, there are 57 species 01 1110 Lance flora which
are known elsewhere in the late Cretaceous and to some extent the early Tertiary
deposits of North America, chiefly the Rocky Mountain region. In the analysis of
the relation of this assemblage to other assemblages, the stratigraphic range 01 spe-
cies elsewhere is determined on the following basis: species restricted to Montanan
age are those whose occurrences, where stratigraphic and palaeontologic relations are
