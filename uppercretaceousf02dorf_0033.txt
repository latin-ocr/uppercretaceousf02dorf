Rhanmus? minutus Knowlton.l The Corbin collection of Hell Creek plants at
Princeton University contains excellent specimens of Quercus? viburm'folz‘a Lesque-
reux and F icus? tri'ncrm's Knowlton, which have not been previously recorded.2

An analysis 01 1116 Colgate—Hell Greek flora gives the following summary:

Τ116 short-ranging Lancian species, restricted elsewhere to deposits lying be-
tween the Splzenod'z'scus zone and the top of the Tr'z'ceralops zone, 316 35 follows:

Anona‘? robusta Laurophyllum wardiana
Carpites lakesii Magnolia dakotana
Carpites lancensis Magnolia lakesii
Cinnamomum? affine Palaeoaster inquirenda
Diospyros berryana Platanophyllum montanum
Dombeyopsis colgatensis Rhamnus‘? minutus

Ficus? ceratops Salix lancensis

Fraxinus leii Sequoia dakotensis
Grewiopsis saportana Viburnum marginatum

This analysis shows that the Colgate—Hell Creek flora is closely comparable
with the flora 01 1116 type Lance and has a majority of species restricted elsewhere
exclusively to beds of Lancian age. As a test case the analysis indicates perfect
agreement between plants, vertebrates, marine invertebrates, and stratigraphy in
the correlation of the Colgate—Hell Creek beds with those of the Lance formation at
its type locality.

The close relationship 01 1116 Colgate—Hell Creek 11013 10 11131 01 1116 type
Lance is seen in the fact that of 38 species with outside distribution, 29 (76 per cent)
are known in the type Lance flora. This is 3 high degree 01 resemblance and is per-
haps somewhat higher than could normally be expected in view of the factors, men-
tioned above, which contribute toward preventing absolute identity of contem-
poraneous 105511 assemblages.

The time relations here believed to exist between the Colgate—Hell Creek
deposits and those of the Lance formation 31 115 type locality are shown in figure 3.
