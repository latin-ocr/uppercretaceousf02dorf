LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 127

Aside from its occurrence in the type Lance flora, this species is known only from the upper
Mesaverde group and the Vermejo formation.

Occurrence—Localities P3854, P3858.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal.‚ Plesiotypes Nos. 2453, 2454.

Family SALVINIACEAE?
Genus SALVINIA (Micheli) Schreber Τ

Salvinia? sp.
(Plate 4, Fig. 4)
Salvinia sp.‚1{n0wlton,Bull.Geolfioc,Amer„ vol. 8, 133, 1897; Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.. vol. 11,207, 1909.

In the collections at the U. S. National Museum there is a single specimen, here figured,
which Knowlton regarded as belonging to the genus Salvinz'a. Unfortunately the two incomplete
pinnules on the specimen are too poorly preserved to bring out the details of venation and of pitting
which are essential for description 01· identification.

Occurrence—U. S. Geol. Survey Locality 1462.

Collection—U. S. National Museum, No. 40m9.

Fern (gen. et sp. now), Knowlton, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci, vol. 11, 207, 1909.

There are 11 well-preserved specimens of this species, of which 9 are in the collections of the
U. S. National Museum.

Description—Pinnules relatively small, averaging 6-9 mm. long and 3—5 mm. wide, oblong-
elliptic, entire-margined‚ and with fine, numerous, anastomosing veins obliqnely diverging from
an indistinct midrib; pinnules closely spaced on pinna in alternate arrangement, attached only by
central part of base; ultimate disposition of pinnae unknown; fertile parts not preserved.

I have been unable to find any living or fossil ferns with which these delicate specimens can
be adequately compared.

Occurrence—Localities P3856, P3858; U. S. Geol. Survey Locality 1462.
Collection—U. S. National Museum, Cotype Nos. 40250, 40250a (counterpart); U. C. Mus.
Pal„ Cotypes Nos. 2455, 2456.

Family EQUISETACEAE
Genus EQUISETUM Linnc'*

Equisetum sp.
(Plate 6, Figs. 2, 3)
Equi-selum sp.?, Knowlton, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci„ vol. 11, 207, 1909.

There are 3 well-preserved specimens and several fragments of ribbed, jointed stems clearly
referable to the genus Equisetum. There is also an excellent specimen of this form in the Lance
collections from this same area in the U. S. National Museum (specimen No. 1007 [1462]). As is
usually the case, none of these specimens shows features of diagnostic value for specific identifica-
tion. In addition to jointed stems, the Lance Creek collections also contain a specimen (fig. 3)
which I regard as a pair os typical equisetaceous tubers, and another specimen (fig. 2) which is
clearly an impression of a nodal diaphragm.
