adjacent strata. The report on this visit was published in 1897.¹ At this time
Knowlton regarded the plants as indicative of the “true La1·a1nie’' age of the “ Cera-
tops beds,'' that is, equivalent to the Upper Cretaceous Laramie formation of the
Denver basin, and of the same age as the plant-bearing “Black Buttes beds'' of
southwestern Wyoming. The fresh-water invertebrates and the dinosaurs corrob-
orated this conclusion. The stratigraphic section, as observed by Stanton and
Knowlton, showed a conformable sequence from the Pierre shales up through the
F ox Hills sandstone, the “Ceratops beds,” and finally the “F ort Union group.’'
The “ F ort Union '' age of the beds overlying the “ Ceratops beds ⁷³ was determined on
plant evidence and on the absence of dinosaur remains.²

The complete descriptions and discussions of the ceratopsian dinosaurs, includ-
ing those of the Lance Creek area, were published by Hatcher and Lull a decade
later.³ The map (plate 51) accompanying that report showed both the exact locali-
ties where the dinosaurs had been collected and the areal limits of the beds, which
were here called the “ Converse County beds⁷’ and the “Lance Creek beds,’' 4 The
fauna was regarded as of true Laramie (Cretaceous) age, and at least in part con-
temporaneous with the dinosaurs from near Black Buttes, Wyoming and from the
“Hell Creek beds’' of Montana.

Up to 1909 there was apparent unanimity of published opinion for the Creta-
ceous age of the “ Ceratops beds’' of the Lance Creek area. In that year, however,
Knowlton changed his opinion concerning both their stratigraphic relations and
their age. He concluded:

“Conformably below the beds by some geologists considered as the true Fort Union occur
dark-colored sandstoneS, clays and shales, which have often been incorrectly referred to the
Laramie, or its equivalent, but which are stratigraphically and paleontologically distinct from the
Laramie, and the contention is here made that these beds, which include the ‘Hell Creek beds'
and so-called ‘sember beds' of Montana, the ‘Ceratops beds' or ‘Lance Creek beds’ of Wyoming,
and their stratigraphic and paleontologic equivalents elsewhere, are to be regarded as constituting
the lower member of the Fort Union formation, and are Eocene in age.” ⁵

In this paper Knowlton included a revised list of the plants collected from the
“Ceratops beds’' of the Lance Creek area ; this differed considerably from the one
previously published.G Of 48 recognized forms, only 16 species were specifically
identified; of 14 species having an outside distribution, 9 were reported known from
the Fort Union. In view of the fact that 6 of these 9 species were not mentioned in
Knowlton's previous lists and have not been seen in any of my own larger collections
from the “Ceratops beds,'' I have been much concerned about their validity. An
examination of Knowlton's collections at the U. S. National Museum has revealed
that the specirnens representing 4 of the species were actually collected from the
acknowledged Fort Union beds above the top of the “Ceratops beds,'' and those
representing 3 speeies are not to be found. The remaining 2 species, Sequoia norden-
