not known to occur in “Fort Union” sediments or other formations of undisputed Paleocene or
later ssghee reference of this species to the existing genus Nelumbo seems rather certain; no other
modern leaves have come to my attention which have the combination of features observed in the

Genus Ν YMPHAEITES Sternberg
Nymphaeites browni Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 10, Fig. 9)

The figured specimen, and one other from the collections of the U. S. National Museum, are
the only ones of this kind encountered.

Description—Leaf cordate-orbicular, about 3.5—4 cm. in diameter, with entire margin and
deeply cordate base ; veins radiating from base, about 14 in number, irregularly forking acutely
toward the margin, usually twice or three times ; tertiary venation not preserved ; texture appar-

ently'i'al‘firsbspi‘elzldiiizs, which differs mainly in its well-defined cordate base from the other species of

N ymphaeaceae in the Lance flora, is comparable in some of its characters to Castalia? duttoniana
Knowlton ² from the Mesaverde formation of southeastern Wyoming. The deeply cordate base,
however, clearly distinguishes it from that species as well as other fossil species. Its modern
relationship is clearly with the Nymphaeaceae.

The species is named for Dr. Roland W. Brown, of the U. S. Geological Survey.

The 3 specimens figured are the best of 6 impressions of this leaf form in the collections.
These cannot be distinguished on any valid‚ natural basis from the figured or type specimens of

the several species listed above.
In their discussions of N elumbo dazvsom', both Berry and Brown united all the above species

into one, on the basis of valid resemblances in essential details. No other leaves of comparable
size and characteristics have been reported from the Mesozoic or Cenozoic of North America.
The species is at present known in the upper Mesaverde, Belly River, Vermejo, Whitemud,
Colgate, and type Lance floras. It is not reported from any deposits of known Paleocene or later
age.

As was intimated by Berry, the gener-ic reference of this species to N elumbo is doubtful. Ι
have not seen any leaves of modern species of Nelumbo which are comparable with the sossil
specimens either in size or in average number of secondary veins. The leaves of the living Brasenia,
on the other hand, are more nearly similar; sce, for example, Brasenia peltata Pursh. In view of
the general resemblance of the fossil specics to several genera of the Nymphaeaceae, it seems ad-
visable to refer it to the genus N ymphaeites, implying family relationship only.
