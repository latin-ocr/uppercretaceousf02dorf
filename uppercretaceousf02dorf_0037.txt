LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 113

The representation in figure 3 of the age relations of the Laramie and the over-
lying Arapahoe-Denver and Dawson formations is based on an opinion derived from
combination of the evidence of the vertebrates, the plants, and the stratigraphic
succession. The placing of the exact horizon marking the Upper Cretaceous-
Paleocene boundary in the Denver and Dawson beds, if it is determinable at all,
must await further work in the region.

Black Buttes “Laramie” flora—The flora from near Black Buttes in south-
western Wyoming has been discussed ¹ in my report on the Medicine Bow flora,
to which it is closely related. The plant-bearing beds near Black Buttes overlie a
massive coarse sandstone tentatively called “ Fox Hills.’' Diagnostic invertebrates
of true Fox Hills age are lacking, however, although the fauna of the underlying
Lewis shale is clearly of late Montanan age.² Remains of a single species of dino-
saur, Aqathaumas sylvestris Cope, were collected from the same beds that contain
the plant horizons.3 The unique characters of this ceratopsian dinosaur make it
rather unreliable for exact age determination, except, of course, as it places the
beds in the Upper Cretaceous and not the Paleocene. The floral assemblage must
therefore be the chief basis for correlation at the present time.

The latest complete floral list of plant species from the Black Buttes “ Laramie ''
was given by Knowlton in 1919.4 Allowing for subsequent synonymies, this as-
semblage may be analyzed as follows:

No outside distribution ..... 19

Outside distribution ........ 31 (22 111 common with type Lance)
Total number of species. . . ὦ

Short-ranging species: Long-ranging species: Species of uncertain range. . 7
Montanan ........ 0 Montanan-Lancian-Paleocene. 1
Lancian .......... 13 Montanan-Lancian .......... 6
Paleocene. . . . . . . . . Ο Lancian-Paleocene ........... 4
13 11

With a total of 22 species (71 per cent), out of 31 species with outside distribu-
tion, in common with the type Lance flora, the Black Buttes “Laramie'' is clearly
of true Lancian age. This is further corroborated by the 13 short-ranging species,
all of which are elsewhere restricted to deposits of known Lancian age. These
species are as follows:

Apeibopsis? discolor Menispermites cockerelli
Carpites glumaeformis Pisonia? racemosa

Carpites verrucosus Platanophyllum platanoides
Cissus? lobato-crenata Sabalites eocenica
Grewiopsis saportana Saliciphyllum wyomingensis
Laurophyllum coloradensis Viburnum marginatum

Laurophyllum meeki
