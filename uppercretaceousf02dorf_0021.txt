LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 97

the remaining 2 species (Aneimia lanceolata and Platamos coloradensis) occur else-
where only in the Middle Park formation (Paleocene?) of Grand County, Colorado.

In addition to these typioal Paleocene floral assemblages from the lower Fort
Union group of the Lance Creek area, Knowlton has identified another collection of
typical Paleooene species from somewhat higher beds of the Fort Union group a few
miles southwest of the Lance Creek area.l

COMPOSITION OF THE FLORA
SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS

The flora of the type Lance formation, as described in the present report, is
eomposed of 70 reoognizable forms distributed among 32 families. The major
divisions of the plant kingdom are represented in the flora as follows: Dicotyledones,
55 species; Monocotyledones⁷ 6 species ; Coniferales, 2 species ; Ginkgoales‚ 1 species ;
Lycopodiales, 1 species ; Equisetales‚ 1 species; Filicales‚ 4 species. There are 56
forms referred to species previously known, 5 are described as new species, and 9
are given generic designation but are not specifically determinable.

The task of allocating Upper Cretaceous species to their proper botanical
genera continues to be a difficult one. Many of the Lance species are still of very
uncertain systematic position. Others are believed to show only a family relation-
ship to existing forms. Not many can be shown to have a marked resemblance to
living genera. The systematic position of the Lance species, in so far as it is
believed to be determinable, is shown in the following list:
