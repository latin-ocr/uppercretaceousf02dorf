the region.¹ The chief contribution of this report was the observation that the
mammalian remains had been collected from the same zone that had yielded the
dinosaur remains, and were uniformly distributed throughout the entire Lance
formation. Emphasizing the relationships of the mammals, Lull regarded these as
substantiating the testimony of the dinosaurs for the Mesozoic age of the beds.

Reports on the structure and the oil and gas resources of the Lance Creek area
were published in 1921 by Η3110001ἰ,2 and in 1929 by Ε11101γ.3 The area between
Lance Creek and Newcastle, Wyoming was visited at about this time by Dobbin
and Reeside, who convincingly showed that here, as elsewhere, the contact of the
Lance formation and the Fox Hills sandstone is essentially 131311311101131.4 This was
an important observation, since by this time proponents of the contention that the
Lance formation belongs in the Cenozoic had stressed the presence of a major un-
conformity at the top of the Fox Hills.

The report by Dobbin and Barnett 5 011 the Gillette 0031 field, which lies just
north of the Lance Creek area, contains observations of significance to the present
report. The Lance formation in that region is subdivided by Dobbin and Barnett
into two members, which “are respectively correlated with and are directly trace-
able northward into the Hell Creek and Tullock members of the Lance formation as
recognized in eastern Montana. The Hell Creek member is also traceable south-
eastward into the ‘Ceratops beds’ of the Lance Creek area, described by Hatcher and
by Stanton and Knowlton.⁷' ὃ This clearly implies‚ as Ι 113νο 3130 noted in a visit
to the area, that the Tullock member of the Lance, which overlies the Hell Greek, is
directly traceable southeastward into the well-recognized Fort Union beds of the
Lance Creek area. This is in agreement with the evidence of the fossil plants, as
discussed elsewhere in this report, that the Tullock is Paleocene “F ort Union,'’ and
not a part of the Lance. formation as originally defined.

The mammalian remains of the Lance Greek area were included in Simpson's
monograph on American Mesozoic 1113111111313,7 published in 1929. The Lance mam-
malian fauna is regarded (fig. 61 of Simpson) as of latest Cretaceous age. The dino-
saurs of the area were again discussed in 1930 by Russell,S who listed the m'neteen
species known and discussed their relation to other saunas. He concluded that the
Lance formation, as originally defined in the Lance Creek area, is equivalent in
Montana and the Dakotas to only the Hell Creek beds, and that the Tullock and
Cannonball should be provisionally included in the Paleocene. This opinion is now
believed to be substantiated by the positive evidence of the fossil plants of the
present report.

In the past decade the Lance Creek area has not often been the subject of dis-
cussion. In 1933 Lull included a systematis treatment and discussion of the dino-
