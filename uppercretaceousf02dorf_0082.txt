“F ruit nearly round, one centimeter across, emarginate in the lower part at its point of
attachment to a short broken pedicel; surface flat, covered with small obtuse warts. . . . This
seed is surrounded by a flat margin, which may be the borders of a flattened pericarp.’'

Except for its shape, which is somewhat reniform, the Lance Creek specimen is similar in all
observable details to the original Black Buttes specimens. No other comparable fossil forms have
been noted. A suite of much larger impressions of somewhat similar nature have been collected
from the “Fort Union'’ formation near Bear Greek, Montana.¹

I can offer no suggestions as to the systematic relationship of this species. That it belongs
to the plant kingdom is shown by the filmy, dark residue of carbon on its surface. Lesquereux
has pointed out its resemblance to the flattened drupe of a M aynolia.

There are 2 seed impressions and a counterpart from Locality P3855 which agree in every
respect with the figured and type specimens of this species. Seeds of this character are at present
known only from the Medicine Bow and Lance formatioris of Wyoming.

The botanical affinities of this nominal species are still unknown.

Carpites sp.
(Plate 17, Fig. 8)

The figured specimen shows a small, rounded east of a fruit (‘?), which is marked by four
prominent ridges dividing the cast into four equal segments. It is possible that the sossil may
originally have been a partially split husk. It has not been possible to determine its botanical
affinities.

To my knowledge there is no record of fossil fruits or seeds with which the present specimen
may be compared.

Occurrence—Locality P3854.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal., No. 2580.

Carpites sp.
(Plate 17, Fig. 11)

This specimen is a flattened impression of a rounded body, possibly a fruit, extended at both
ends into wedge-shaped, ribbed prolongatioris. The prolongation is larger at one end of the body
than at the other. Within a thin rim the centra! body is almost perfectly circular and is faintly
marked by meridional lines. The botanical affinities of this form are unknown, as are also any
previous fossil records of comparable remains.

Occurrence——Locality P3855.
