My own preliminary statements regarding the plants from the Lance and a discus-
sion of their stratigraphic relationships have preceded the present comprehensive

The palaeobotanical conclusion that the Tullock and Ludlow beds, generally
regarded as the upper member of the Lance formation in regions to the north of the
Lance Creek area, are of early Paleocene age has recently been substantiated by the
study of the foraminifera of the marine Cannonball beds, which interfinger westward
into the Ludlow.³

STRATIGRAPHY

Generaz Section

The sedimentary rocks exposed in the Lance Creek area, as shown in figure 2,
are of Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene, and Oligocene age. The generalized section of
formatioris is as follows:

Tertiary
Oligocene:
While River yroup (nonmarine)
Unconformity
Paleocene:
Fort Union qroup (nonmarine)
Upper Cretaceous
Lance formation (nonmarine)
Fon: Hills safndstone (marine)
Pierre skale (marine)

From the Pierre shale up into the Fort Union group the succession is one of ap-
parently continuous deposition. All these formatioris crop out as a result of erosion
on the steep to gently dipping northwestern limb of an asymmetrieal anticline. The
sediments of the White River group lie essentially horizontally on the dipping,
eroded Pierre shale in the southern part of the region. The best exposures of the
formatioris are to be seen in the banks of the main streams and their numerous
tributaries, all of which are practically dry during the summer months. In the
descriptions which follow, details concerning the Pierre shale and the White River
group are omitted, as these beds have no immediate bearing on the problems con-
cerning the Lance formation.

F occ H ills Sandstone

From the typical dark-gray clay shales of the Pierre shale, exposures in the
Lance Creek area show a gradual transition upward into a succession of light-gray
and grayish-brown sandstones. These have been referred to the Fox Hills sand-
stone ⁴ on the basis of their stratigraphic position, their gross lithology, and their
