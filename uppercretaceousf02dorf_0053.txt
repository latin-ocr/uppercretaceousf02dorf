LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN WYOMING 129

Shaparenko,¹ who has studied the past records of Ginlcyo in detail, does not regard G. laramz'ensz‘s
as a valid species. Brown, on the other hand, distinguishes between G. aclz'antoz'des and G. lara-
miensz's on the basis of the character of mature average leaf forms.² He states: “During Upper
Cretaceous time the average form was still cuneate, but the tendency was to be entire, undulate,
or only slightly bilobate, as in G. laramiensz's. From the Eocene onward the average type was
reniform and bilobate and is typified by G. adiantozssdess’ This is certainly a valid observation,
but is impossible to apply, as Brown has pointed out, unless abundant specimens are secured.
In the Lance Creek collections, only a single, incomplete specimen is known, so that a positive
specific reference cannot be made.

As is indicated in the long list of references above, the well-defined leaves of this form are of
common occurrence in the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks of North America. Whether
or not a single species of Gz'nlcqo has survived from the Upper Cretaceous to the present day cannot
be determined on the basis of leaves alone.

There are 20 specimens of cone impressions and casts in the. collections. The excellent
preservation of one of these (plate 6, fig. 7) as a mud cast makes it possible to compare it with the
casts described by Brown as Sequoz'a dakotensz's. The description given by Brown is as follows:

“Cones, l.5—4 cm. long, 1243 cm. in diameter, with about 30 scales, arranged in two sets
of spiral rows, the steep-angled set in 5 rows, and the flat-angled set in 3 rows The faces of the
scales present sections that are long and narrow, roughly diamond-shaped, but occasionally with
one or two additional angles. Peduncles of the scales abruptly narrowed to the point of attach-
ment at the axis of the cone. Surface of the scales smooth, or sometimes slightly wrinkled.’¹

The single cast in the Lance Creek collection has 28 scales; an examination of the large
number os typical specimens of this species at the U. S. National Museum has shown that this
number of scales is within the range of variability of “about 30 scaleS,yy as described above. The
remaining characters of the cone and of other cone impressions in my collections are precisely as
enumerated by Brown.

At the Lance Creek localities which have yielded them, these cones are always associated
with foliage which is clearly of the Sequoia type (plate 6, figs. 4—6). In view os this invariable
association and the absence of other coniferous foliage at these localities, it is reasonably certain
that the cones and foliage belong to the same species. This foliage cannot be distinguished from
that of such nominal “species” as S. lanysdorfii (Brongniart) Heer, S. nordenslcz'oldi Heer, or S.
obovata Knowlton.³ These “species” have little meaning, either botanically or geologically,
because of their lack of distinguishing characteristics. On foliage characters alone they cannot be
separated from the living S. sempervircns Endlicher. When foliage remains are intimately asso-
ciated with well-defined eones, however, there can be no natural or valid grounds for referring
the foliage and the cones to two distinct “species'’
