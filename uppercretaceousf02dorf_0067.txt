This well-defined leaf form is represented in the collections by 4 well-preserved specimens, of
which the figured specimen is the. most nearly complete. There are also 2 good specimens of it
in the collections from the Lance Creek area in the U. S. National Museum.¹

The original figured specimens of Ficus asarzjolia minor Lesquereux were obtained from the
upper Mesaverde group at Point of Rocks, Wyoming. Additional specimens were subsequently
obtained from the same locality by Knowlton, who referred the specimens with much hesitation
to Ficus asarisolz'a Ettingshausen. Knowlton also recorded the presence of a specimen of this
species from the Black Buttes collection at the U. S. National Museum. I have consulted both
the Mesaverde and Black Buttes specimens at the National Museum and find no essential dif-
ferences between them and the Lance Creek specimens. Berry has rccently obtained identical
leaves from the Whitemud formation of Saskatchewan‚ and has synonymized all previously re-
corded specimens in the species M enispermz'tes belli Berry.

As pointed out by both Knowlton and Berry, there is an unmistakable resemblance of these
leaves to the modern family Menispermaceae.

This species is represented in the collection-3 by 2 fairly complete leaf impressions and several
fragments. The 2 better specimens are slightly larger than the original type specimen from Black
Buttes, Wyoming, though differing in no other way. They are essentially similar in observable
details to the larger leaves figured by Knowlton from the Laramie flora.

In the Rocky Mountain region, this species is now known reliably from abundant specimens
in the Laramie, Medicine Bow, and Black Buttes floras, from fewer specimens in the Lance flora,
and doubtfully from a single fragment in the Raton flora.

As was pointed out in the discussion of Ficus cockerelli in my cited report on the Medicine
Bow flora, the relationships of these leaves to modern genera or species are uncertain, they seem
to resemble the Menispermaceae more closely than any other family examined.
