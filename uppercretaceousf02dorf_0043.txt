LANCE FLORA oF EASTERN WYOMING 119

Here is a typical example of the difficulty encountered when the short-ranging
species of an assemblage are too few for reliability. The presence in the flora of 3
species of pre-Montanan occurrence is a fair indication that it is somewhat older
than any previously discussed. It is to be hoped that larger collections of plants
may be obtained from the Mesaverde formation in order to make its floral assem-
blage of greater value for correlation.

Tullock-Ludlow flora—The contrast between the flora of the type Tullock and
Ludlow and the type Lance has previously been pointed out.l Out of a total of
33 species in the type Tullock-Ludlow, there are 21 species with outside distribution,
of which only 5 are known also from the type Lance, as is shown in table 3. More-
over, these 5 species are all long-ranging species, 3 from Montanan through Paleo-
cene age and 2 from Lancian through Paleocene. Of the total 21 species there are
11 11131 310 restricted elsewhere to Paleocene age, 5 that are known in both Lancian
and Paleocene age, and 5 that range from the Paleocene into the Eocene or later.
It is concluded from these figures that the type Tullock and Ludlow beds, which
310 non-dinosaur-bearing, are of Paleocene age.

It has been shown further ² that other non-dinosaur-bearing beds which else-
where overlie the true Lance or Hell Creek formations have at many localities
yielded plants which are clearly of Paleocene and not Lancian age. These beds are
stratigraphically equivalent to the type Tullock-Ludlow beds, which had previously
been regarded as the upper member of the Lance formation mainly because of their
interfingering relation with the Cannonball beds, whose marine sauna was regarded
as Upper Cretaceous. Recently, however, Fox and Ross have obtained a large
foraminiferal assemblage from the Cannonball which is correlated with the Paleo-
cene Midway of the Gulf Coast.³ Had this correlation been known at the time when
the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary dispute was at high pitch, it seems reasonably
sure that Knowlton would not have included the plants of the Tullock, Ludlow, and
equivalent beds in his “Lance flora.’' It would have been apparent that the flora
of the true Triceratops-bearing Lance and Hell Creek beds is quite distinct from
that of the overlying non-dinosaur-bearing Tullock, Ludlow, and equivalents. It
is now clear that the belief that the plants of the Tullock, Ludlow, and equivalents
belonged to the true Lance was largely responsible for Knowlton's conclusion that
this “ Lance flora'' was essentially a “F ort Union'⁷ (Paleocene) assemblage.

F ort Union flora—As is shown in table 3, there are only 5 species of the Lance
flora which occur also in the widespread Paleocene “ F ort Union '’ beds. Only 1 of
these species, Cercidiphyllum arcticum, is elsewhere restricted to beds of known
Paleocene age; the remaining 4 species are long-ranging forms in both the late
Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The detailed differences between the flora of the
type Fort Union and equivalent beds and that of the type Lance has already been

are likewise easily distinguishable from the Fort Union flora or other floras of known
