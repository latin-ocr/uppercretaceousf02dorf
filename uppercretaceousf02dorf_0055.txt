LANCE FLORA OF EASTERN ΨΥΟΜΙΝΟ 131

U. S. National Museum (specimens No. 5, Locality 8536). Comparable scales, referred to Dam-
mara acicularz's Knowlton,¹ from the J udith River formation differ from the Lance and Laramie
species chiefly in their consistently shorter apical spines; they undoubtedly belong to the same
genus.

Ι can see no justification sor the retention os the generic name Sequoz'a for this species.
N either the foliage nor the cone scales resemble in any way the living species of Sequoia. An
examination of herbarium specimens of all available species of conifers at the New York Botanical
Garden has convinced me that the closest resemblance is to the living Araucariaceae. The
foliage is of the same type seen in Araucaria ezcelsa (Lamb.) R. ΒΓ. and A. cunninqhamii Ait.
The needles of these species are radially arranged, are marked by a medial fold or false midrib, and
are attached to the branches in the same manner as in the fossil specimens. They differ only in
their shorter length and greater width. It is significant, moreover, that the eones of these living
species are deciduous, as in the fossil species, and have cone scales which closely resemble those of
the fossil specimens in size‚ shape, and terminal spines.

Family TYPHACEAE

Genus TYPHA Linne
Typha sp.

There are 9 speeimens of this ubiquitous form. None of these has characters sufficiently
well defined to attempt specific determination or description.

Remains of this type, generally referred to Typha, are common throughout Cretaceous and
Tertiary time. Of no use for correlation purposes because of their lack of diagnostic features,
they indicate a wet habitat, with inadequate drainage resulting in shallow standing bodies of water.

Occurrence—Localities P3651, P3853, P3856, P3857, P3858, P3859.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal., Nos. 2483, 2484.

Family CYPERACEAE

Genus CYPERACITES Schimper
Cyperacites sp.

Remains os finely parallel-veined leaves, referable to the form genus Cyperacites, are fairly
abundant in the collection from Locality P3857. These are the same as other specimens from
the Lance Creek area which are in the collections at the U. S. National Museum.² These mono-
cotyledonous leaves do not have any characters by which they can be defined or recognized as
“speeies'’; they are recorded here only for their ecological connotations.

Occurrence-—Locality P3857.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal., No. 2485.
