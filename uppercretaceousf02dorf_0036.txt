Of the 23 short-ranging species, only 1, Anez'mia elonyata (Newberry) Knowlton,
has elsewhere been known only from deposits of Montanan age. This single dis-
cordance is minimized by the serious doubt which Knowlton cast on the identifica-
tion of the specimen from the Laramie formation.¹ The remaining restricted spe-
cies, all of which are known elsewhere only from rocks of true Lancian age, are
as follows:

Anona? robusta J uglans newberryi
Apeibopsis‘? laramiensis Juglans praerugosa

Aristolochites brittoni
Asplenium? coloradensis
Carpites lakesii
Cinnamomum‘? affine
Diospyros berryana
Dombeyopsis trivialis
Dryopteris‘? carbonensis

Laurophyllum coloradensis
Laurophyllum wardiana
Magnolia lakesii
Menispermites cockerelli
Palaeoaster inquirenda
Pistaeia eriensis
Rhamnus? minutus

Ficus cowanensis Saliciphyllum wyomingensis
Juglans leconteana Zizyphus hendersoni

In regard to the Arapahoe-Denver and Dawson formations, which overlie the
Laramie formation, the Lancian age of at least their lowest part has already been
established, on the basis of both Triceratops dinosaurs² and Lancian species of
plants.³ Many of the older plant collections of the Denver region were obtained
without duc regard to their exact stratigraphic position. As a consequence it is
often difficult to determine whether or not a species is restricted to the lower beds
of the Arapahoe-Dcnver or Dawson. Pending further work in the region, it can
be said at present that at least the following dominant or typical Montanan and
Lancian specics arc known from the lower part of the Denver-Dawson, and not
from the uppcr part, which is believed to be of Palcocene age:

Ccrcidiphyllum elliptieum Ficus? trincrvis
Cinnamomum linisolium Laurophyllum coloradensis
Cissus? lobato-crcnata Myrtophyllum torreyi

Cornophyllum wardii
Dillenites elcburni
Dombeyopsis obtusa
Ficus coloradensis
Ficus planicostata
