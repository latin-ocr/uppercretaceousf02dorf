There are about a dozen nearly complete specimens of this well-defined species and an equal
number of identifiable fragments. The majority of these are from Locality P3651, where this
type of leaf is one of the two dominants. The best specimens are unfortunately curled and
twisted, making them difficult or impossible to photograph for reproduction.

In addition to its occurrence in the type Lance formation, this species is now reliably known
from the Ericson-Almond (Mesaverde), Medicine Bow, Raton, and Denver formations.

As was pointed out in my original discussion of this species, its modern affinities are somewhat
in doubt, though the resemblance to the leaves of the living Cornus is undeniable.

Occurrence—Localities P3651, P3853.

Family OLEACEAE
Genus FRAXINUS Linne

Fraxinus leii Berry
(Plate 13, Figs. 2, 3, 7)

This species is one of the ten dominants in the Lance Creek collectione, in which it is repre-
sented by 53 leaf impressions. Many of these are essentially complete leaves in an excellent
state of preservation. The leaves here figured are virtually identical in all their characters with
the type specimens figured by Berry.

In the course of study of these leaves it became apparent that they are likely to be confused
with those of Dryophyllum subsalcatam Lesquereux,¹ which they undeniably resemble in a general
way. Brown has considered these two species synonymous.² In my opinion, the leaves of
Fraxinus lez'z' may be distinguished by the following characters: (1) shape distinctly narrower,
approaching linear rather than lanceolate; (2) teeth more regularly disposed, never absent or
poorly developed, and distinctly spinous; (3) both secondary and tertiary veins thin; (4) secondary
veins at more regular intervals. Among the numerous excellent specimens of Dryophyllum sub-
salcalum in the Colgate sandstone and Hell Creek collections at the U. S. National Museum, none
was seen which had the combination of these definitive characters of Fraxinus lcii.

In addition to its occurrence in the Lance formation, this species is reported and figured by
Berry from the Ravenscrag formation of Saskatchewan. This specimen does not seem to me to
have the diagnostic characters of the original types, particularly in its shape and the character
os its marginal teeth.

The generic reference of this species to Fraxinus was made by Berry on the basis of resem-
blance of the original Lance leaves to those os F. tamariscisolz'a Vahl of the Old World.

Occurrence—Localities P3651, P3853, P3854, P3857, P3858.
