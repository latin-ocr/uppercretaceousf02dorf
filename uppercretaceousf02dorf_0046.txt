122 CONTRlBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

the presence of any one of the restricted Lancian species in an assemblage of un-
known age should indicate Lancian age. In actual practice, however, no such
assumption can be made with confidence, since an extension of the range of some of
these species can reasonably be expected to be made by future discoveries. An
association of a number of these restricted species in a flora should indicate Lancian
age. Some species are considered more reliable than others because of their abun-
dance and their well-defined characters. Also there are a few species which are
absent from the type Lance, for unknown reasons, which are abundant in other
floras of Lancian age. The complete association of species which I consider the
best indices of Lancian age is as follows:

Anona‘? robusta Menispermites cockerelli
Dombeyopsis trivialis Nelumbo tenuifolia

Ficus? ceratops Pistacia ericnsis

Fraxinus leii Platanophyllum montanum
Grewiopsis saportana Sabalites eocenica
Laurophyllum wardiana Viburnum marginatum

Magnoliophyllum cordatum

In addition to these restricted species there are others which though of wider
stratigraphic range are, so far as is known, abundant only in floras of Lancian age.
These dominants are as follows:

Cercidiphyllum ellipticum Ficus? trinervis

Dillenites cleburni Quercus? viburnifolia
Dryophyllum subfalcatum Sequoia dakotensis
Ficus planicostata Vitis stantoni

Both of these lists arc obviously to be regarded only as showing the status of
these species in the present state of knowledge. As work progresses on the late
Cretaceous and early Tertiary floras of the Rocky Mountain region there will un-
doubtedly be deletions and additions in both lists.

SUMMARY

The present report discusses the flora collected from the Lance formation at its
type locality, Niobrara County, Wyoming. The plant remains were obtained from
nine localities in the vicinity of Lance Creek; some additional specimens from this
area were secured through loan from the U. S. National Muscum.

The type Lance formation lies conformably above the F ox Hills sandstone,
which carries the typical late Montanan marine fauna of the Sphenodiscus zone,
and below the typical beds of the Paleocene Fort Union group. Numerous dinosaur
remains of the late Cretaccous Triccratops zone have long been known from the
same parts of the type Lance formation that have now yielded numerous plant
remains. Late Cretaceous mammals and fresh-water mollusks are also recorded
from the same bcds.

The flora of the type Lance formation, as described in the present report, com-
priscs 70 recognizable forms, chiefly of dicotyledons. There are 56 forms referred
to species previously known, 5 arc described as new species, and 9 are given generic
